"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possessionof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on hisfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the mindsof the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful propertyof some one or other of their daughters."
"""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day, ""have you heard thatNetherfield Park is let at last?""Mr."
Bennet replied that he had not.
"""But it is,"" returned she; ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and shetold me all about it.""Mr."
Bennet made no answer.
"""Do you not want to know who has taken it?"""
cried his wife impatiently.
"""_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
"""This was invitation enough."
"""Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is takenby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he camedown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so muchdelighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that heis to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are tobe in the house by the end of next week."
"""""What is his name?""""Bingley."
"""""Is he married or single?""""Oh!"
"Single, my dear, to be sure!"
A single man of large fortune; four orfive thousand a year.
What a fine thing for our girls!
"""""How so?"
How can it affect them?
"""""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" replied his wife, ""how can you be so tiresome!"
Youmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.
"""""Is that his design in settling here?""""Design!"
"Nonsense, how can you talk so!"
"But it is very likely that he_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him assoon as he comes."
"""""I see no occasion for that."
"You and the girls may go, or you may sendthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you areas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of theparty."
"""""My dear, you flatter me."
"I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, butI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now."
"When a woman has fivegrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
"""""In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"""""But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes intothe neighbourhood."
"""""It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
"""""But consider your daughters."
Only think what an establishment it wouldbe for one of them.
"Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined togo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit nonewcomers."
"Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ tovisit him if you do not."
"""""You are over-scrupulous, surely."
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be veryglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of myhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; thoughI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.
"""""I desire you will do no such thing."
"Lizzy is not a bit better than theothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half sogood-humoured as Lydia."
But you are always giving _her_ the preference.
"""""They have none of them much to recommend them,"" replied he; ""they areall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more ofquickness than her sisters.""""Mr."
"Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way?"
Youtake delight in vexing me.
You have no compassion for my poor nerves.
"""""You mistake me, my dear."
I have a high respect for your nerves.
Theyare my old friends.
I have heard you mention them with considerationthese last twenty years at least.
"""""Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
"""""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of fourthousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"""""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will notvisit them."
"""""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit themall.""Mr."
"Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years hadbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character."
_Her_ mindwas less difficult to develop.
"She was a woman of mean understanding,little information, and uncertain temper."
"When she was discontented,she fancied herself nervous."
The business of her life was to get herdaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.Mr.
Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.
"Hehad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuringhis wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit waspaid she had no knowledge of it."
It was then disclosed in the followingmanner.
"Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, hesuddenly addressed her with:""I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
"""""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"" said her motherresentfully, ""since we are not to visit."
"""""But you forget, mamma,"" said Elizabeth, ""that we shall meet him at theassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
"""""I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing."
She has two niecesof her own.
"She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinionof her."
"""""No more have I,"" said Mr. Bennet; ""and I am glad to find that you donot depend on her serving you.""Mrs."
"Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to containherself, began scolding one of her daughters."
"""Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake!"
Have a littlecompassion on my nerves.
You tear them to pieces.
"""""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"" said her father; ""she timesthem ill.""""I do not cough for my own amusement,"" replied Kitty fretfully."
"""When isyour next ball to be, Lizzy?"
"""""To-morrow fortnight."
"""""Aye, so it is,"" cried her mother, ""and Mrs. Long does not come backtill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,for she will not know him herself."
"""""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduceMr."
Bingley to _her_.
"""""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with himmyself; how can you be so teasing?"
"""""I honour your circumspection."
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainlyvery little.
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of afortnight.
"But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,Mrs."
"Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, asshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I willtake it on myself."
"""The girls stared at their father."
"Mrs. Bennet said only, ""Nonsense,nonsense!"
"""""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"""
cried he.
"""Doyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid onthem, as nonsense?"
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.
"What say you,Mary?"
"For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and readgreat books and make extracts."
"""Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how."
"""While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"" he continued, ""let us return to Mr.Bingley."
"""""I am sick of Mr. Bingley,"" cried his wife."
"""I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before?"
IfI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have calledon him.
"It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, wecannot escape the acquaintance now."
"""The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joywas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all thewhile."
"""How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!"
But I knew I shouldpersuade you at last.
I was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance.
"Well, how pleased I am!"
"and it is such agood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said aword about it till now."
"""""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,"" said Mr. Bennet; and,as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife."
"""What an excellent father you have, girls!"""
"said she, when the door wasshut."
"""I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;or me, either, for that matter."
"At our time of life it is not sopleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; butfor your sakes, we would do anything."
"Lydia, my love, though you _are_the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the nextball.""""Oh!"""
"said Lydia stoutly, ""I am not afraid; for though I _am_ theyoungest, I'm the tallest."
"""The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him todinner.Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her fivedaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley."
"They attacked himin various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, anddistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were atlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,Lady Lucas."
Her report was highly favourable.
Sir William had beendelighted with him.
"He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremelyagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party."
Nothing could be more delightful!
To be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very livelyhopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.
"""If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,""said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, ""and all the others equally wellmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for."
"""In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat aboutten minutes with him in his library."
"He had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he hadheard much; but he saw only the father."
"The ladies were somewhat morefortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upperwindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and alreadyhad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all."
"Mr. Bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unableto accept the honour of their invitation, etc."
Mrs. Bennet was quitedisconcerted.
"She could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear thathe might be always flying about from one place to another, and neversettled at Netherfield as he ought to be."
"Lady Lucas quieted her fearsa little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to geta large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingleywas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted theday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought onlysix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin."
"And whenthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only fivealtogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, andanother young man.Mr."
"Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasantcountenance, and easy, unaffected manners."
"His sisters were fine women,with an air of decided fashion."
"His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merelylooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, andthe report which was in general circulation within five minutesafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year."
"The gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared hewas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to beproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not allhis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a mostforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be comparedwith his friend.Mr."
"Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of givingone himself at Netherfield."
Such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves.
What a contrast between him and his friend!
"Mr. Darcy dancedonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined beingintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.His character was decided."
"He was the proudest, most disagreeable manin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters.Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sitdown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friendto join it."
"""Come, Darcy,"" said he, ""I must have you dance."
I hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner.
You had much betterdance.
"""""I certainly shall not."
"You know how I detest it, unless I amparticularly acquainted with my partner."
At such an assembly as thisit would be insupportable.
"Your sisters are engaged, and there is notanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up with."
"""""I would not be so fastidious as you are,"" cried Mr. Bingley, ""for akingdom!"
"Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls inmy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you seeuncommonly pretty."
"""""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"" said Mr.Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.""Oh!"
She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!
"But there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and Idare say very agreeable."
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.
"""""Which do you mean?"""
"and turning round he looked for a moment atElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:""She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men."
"You had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.""Mr."
Bingley followed his advice.
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings toward him.
"She told the story,however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family."
Mrs.Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfieldparty.
"Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had beendistinguished by his sisters."
"Jane was as much gratified by this asher mother could be, though in a quieter way."
Elizabeth felt Jane'spleasure.
"Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had beenfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball."
"They returned, therefore, in goodspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which theywere the principal inhabitants."
They found Mr. Bennet still up.
Witha book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations.
"He had rather hoped that his wife's views onthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had adifferent story to hear.""Oh!"
"my dear Mr. Bennet,"" as she entered the room, ""we have had a mostdelightful evening, a most excellent ball."
"I wish you had been there.Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it."
"Everybody said how wellshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced withher twice!"
"Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with hertwice!"
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime.
"First of all, he asked Miss Lucas."
I was so vexed to see him standup with her!
"But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobodycan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was goingdown the dance."
"So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, andasked her for the two next."
"Then the two third he danced with Miss King,and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--""""If he had had any compassion for _me_,"" cried her husband impatiently,""he would not have danced half so much!"
"For God's sake, say no more ofhis partners."
"Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!""""Oh!"
"my dear, I am quite delighted with him."
He is so excessivelyhandsome!
And his sisters are charming women.
I never in my life sawanything more elegant than their dresses.
"I dare say the lace upon Mrs.Hurst's gown--""Here she was interrupted again."
Mr. Bennet protested against anydescription of finery.
"She was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and someexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr."
Darcy.
"""But I can assure you,"" she added, ""that Lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not atall worth pleasing."
So high and so conceited that there was no enduringhim!
"He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so verygreat!"
Not handsome enough to dance with!
"I wish you had been there, mydear, to have given him one of your set-downs."
I quite detest the man.
"""When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious inher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how verymuch she admired him."
"""He is just what a young man ought to be,"" said she, ""sensible,good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so muchease, with such perfect good breeding!"
"""""He is also handsome,"" replied Elizabeth, ""which a young man oughtlikewise to be, if he possibly can."
His character is thereby complete.
"""""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time."
Idid not expect such a compliment.
"""""Did not you?"
I did for you.
But that is one great difference betweenus.
"Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never."
Whatcould be more natural than his asking you again?
He could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other womanin the room.
No thanks to his gallantry for that.
"Well, he certainly isvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him."
You have liked many astupider person.
"""""Dear Lizzy!""""Oh!"
"you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.You never see a fault in anybody."
All the world are good and agreeablein your eyes.
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in yourlife.
"""""I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speakwhat I think."
"""""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder."
"With _your_good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers!"
Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with iteverywhere.
"But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take thegood of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothingof the bad--belongs to you alone."
"And so you like this man's sisters,too, do you?"
Their manners are not equal to his.
"""""Certainly not--at first."
But they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them.
"Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keephis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in her."
"""Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, shewas very little disposed to approve them."
"They were in fact very fineladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in thepower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud andconceited."
"They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of thefirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousandpounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and ofassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respectentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others."
They were ofa respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeplyimpressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and theirown had been acquired by trade.Mr.
"Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase anestate, but did not live to do it."
"Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, andsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation topurchase.His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her."
"Mr. Bingley had not been ofage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendationto look at Netherfield House."
"He did look at it, and into it forhalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principalrooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took itimmediately.Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite ofgreat opposition of character."
"Bingley was endeared to Darcy by theeasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied."
"On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingleyhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.In understanding, Darcy was the superior."
"Bingley was by no meansdeficient, but Darcy was clever."
"He was at the same time haughty,reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were notinviting."
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.
"Bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continuallygiving offense.The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic."
"Bingley had never met with more pleasant people orprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentiveto him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon feltacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could notconceive an angel more beautiful."
"Darcy, on the contrary, had seen acollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, fornone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none receivedeither attention or pleasure."
"Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,but she smiled too much.Mrs."
"Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admiredher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and onewhom they would not object to know more of."
"Miss Bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose.Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennetswere particularly intimate."
"Sir William Lucas had been formerly in tradein Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly."
"It had given him adisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a houseabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to allthe world."
"For, though elated by his rank, it did not render himsupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody."
"Bynature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.James's had made him courteous.Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet."
They had several children.
"The eldestof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, wasElizabeth's intimate friend.That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk overa ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assemblybrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate."
"""_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"" said Mrs. Bennet with civilself-command to Miss Lucas."
"""_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice."
"""""Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.""""Oh!"
"you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice."
To besure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--somethingabout Mr.
Robinson.
"""""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did notI mention it to you?"
"Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Merytonassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great manypretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?"
and hisanswering immediately to the last question: 'Oh!
"the eldest Miss Bennet,beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point."
"'""""Upon my word!"
"Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem asif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."
"""""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"" saidCharlotte."
"""Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."
"""""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by hisill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quitea misfortune to be liked by him."
Mrs. Long told me last night that hesat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.
"""""Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"""
said Jane.
"""I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."
"""""Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and hecould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry atbeing spoke to."
"""""Miss Bingley told me,"" said Jane, ""that he never speaks much,unless among his intimate acquaintances."
With _them_ he is remarkablyagreeable.
"""""I do not believe a word of it, my dear."
"If he had been so veryagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long."
"But I can guess how itwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he hadheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come tothe ball in a hack chaise."
"""""I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,"" said Miss Lucas, ""but Iwish he had danced with Eliza."
"""""Another time, Lizzy,"" said her mother, ""I would not dance with _him_,if I were you."
"""""I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."
"""""His pride,"" said Miss Lucas, ""does not offend _me_ so much as prideoften does, because there is an excuse for it."
"One cannot wonder that sovery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,should think highly of himself."
"If I may so express it, he has a _right_to be proud."
"""""That is very true,"" replied Elizabeth, ""and I could easily forgive_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."
"""""Pride,"" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections, ""is a very common failing, I believe."
"By all that I haveever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that humannature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of somequality or other, real or imaginary."
"Vanity and pride are differentthings, though the words are often used synonymously."
A person maybe proud without being vain.
"Pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."
"""""If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,"" cried a young Lucas, who came withhis sisters, ""I should not care how proud I was."
"I would keep a pack offoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."
"""""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"" said Mrs.Bennet; ""and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottledirectly."
"""The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that shewould, and the argument ended only with the visit.The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield."
The visitwas soon returned in due form.
"Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew onthe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towardsthe two eldest."
"By Jane, this attention was received with the greatestpleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatmentof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising inall probability from the influence of their brother's admiration."
"Itwas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her andto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Janeunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and auniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicionsof the impertinent."
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
"""It may perhaps be pleasant,"" replied Charlotte, ""to be able to imposeon the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded."
"If a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally inthe dark."
"There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself."
We can all_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement.
In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_affection than she feels.
"Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but hemay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
"""""But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow."
"If I canperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not todiscover it too."
"""""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."
"""""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to concealit, he must find it out."
"""""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her."
"But, though Bingley and Janemeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together."
Jane shouldtherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command hisattention.
"When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure forfalling in love as much as she chooses."
"""""Your plan is a good one,"" replied Elizabeth, ""where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determinedto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it."
Butthese are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.
"As yet,she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of itsreasonableness."
She has known him only a fortnight.
"She danced fourdances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,and has since dined with him in company four times."
This is not quiteenough to make her understand his character.
"""""Not as you represent it."
"Had she merely _dined_ with him, she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you mustremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and fourevenings may do a great deal."
"""""Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that theyboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any otherleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."
"""""Well,"" said Charlotte, ""I wish Jane success with all my heart; andif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth."
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
"Ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other orever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in theleast."
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife.
"""""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound."
"You know it is notsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
"""Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend."
"Mr. Darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at theball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise."
"But nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardlyhad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes."
Tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.
"Though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness."
"Ofthis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with.He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversingwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others."
His doing sodrew her notice.
"It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party wereassembled."
"""What does Mr. Darcy mean,"" said she to Charlotte, ""by listening to myconversation with Colonel Forster?"
"""""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."
"""""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I seewhat he is about."
"He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin bybeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."
"""On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, sheturned to him and said:""Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonlywell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball atMeryton?"
"""""With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a ladyenergetic."
"""""You are severe on us."
"""""It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,"" said Miss Lucas."
"""I am goingto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."
"""""You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting meto play and sing before anybody and everybody!"
"If my vanity had takena musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I wouldreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit ofhearing the very best performers."""
"On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,she added, ""Very well, if it must be so, it must."""
"And gravely glancingat Mr. Darcy, ""There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is ofcourse familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and Ishall keep mine to swell my song."
"""Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital."
"After a songor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several thatshe would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was alwaysimpatient for display.Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given herapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceitedmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached."
"Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to withmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at theend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude byScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly indancing at one end of the room.Mr."
"Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was toomuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas washis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:""What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!"
Thereis nothing like dancing after all.
I consider it as one of the firstrefinements of polished society.
"""""Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongstthe less polished societies of the world."
Every savage can dance.
"""Sir William only smiled."
"""Your friend performs delightfully,"" hecontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; ""and I doubtnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr."
Darcy.
"""""You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."
"""""Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight."
Doyou often dance at St.
James's?
"""""Never, sir."
"""""Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"
"""""It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
"""""You have a house in town, I conclude?""Mr."
Darcy bowed.
"""I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fondof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air ofLondon would agree with Lady Lucas."
"""He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposedto make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he wasstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out toher:""My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?"
"Mr. Darcy, you must allowme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner."
"Youcannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you."
"""And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, thoughextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantlydrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:""Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing."
"I entreat younot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.""Mr."
"Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand, but in vain."
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William atall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
"""You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to denyme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes theamusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige usfor one half-hour.""""Mr."
"Darcy is all politeness,"" said Elizabeth, smiling."
"""He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such apartner?"
"""Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away."
"Her resistance had notinjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with somecomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:""I can guess the subject of your reverie."
"""""I should imagine not."
"""""You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many eveningsin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.I was never more annoyed!"
"The insipidity, and yet the noise--thenothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people!"
What wouldI give to hear your strictures on them!
"""""Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you."
My mind was moreagreeably engaged.
I have been meditating on the very great pleasurewhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.
"""Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired hewould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.Mr."
"Darcy replied with great intrepidity:""Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
"""""Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"""
repeated Miss Bingley.
"""I am all astonishment.How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish youjoy?"
"""""That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask."
"A lady'simagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from loveto matrimony, in a moment."
I knew you would be wishing me joy.
"""""Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter isabsolutely settled."
"You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you."
"""He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose toentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced herthat all was safe, her wit flowed long.Mr."
"Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother'sfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supplythe deficiency of his."
"Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, andhad left her four thousand pounds.She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk totheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled inLondon in a respectable line of trade.The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt andto a milliner's shop just over the way."
"The two youngest of the family,Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothingbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of newsthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn somefrom their aunt."
"At present, indeed, they were well supplied both withnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in theneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was theheadquarters.Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the mostinteresting intelligence."
Every day added something to their knowledgeof the officers' names and connections.
"Their lodgings were not long asecret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves."
"Mr.Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store offelicity unknown before."
They could talk of nothing but officers; andMr.
"Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animationto their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to theregimentals of an ensign.After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.Bennet coolly observed:""From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be twoof the silliest girls in the country."
"I have suspected it some time, butI am now convinced."
"""Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfectindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going thenext morning to London."
"""I am astonished, my dear,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""that you should be soready to think your own children silly."
"If I wished to think slightinglyof anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."
"""""If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."
"""""Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."
"""""This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree."
"Ihad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I mustso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonlyfoolish."
"""""My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir father and mother."
"When they get to our age, I dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do."
"I remember the time whenI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at myheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thoughtColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's inhis regimentals."
"""""Mamma,"" cried Lydia, ""my aunt says that Colonel Forster and CaptainCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they firstcame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.""Mrs."
"Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman witha note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waitedfor an answer."
"Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she waseagerly calling out, while her daughter read,""Well, Jane, who is it from?"
What is it about?
What does he say?
"Well,Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."
"""""It is from Miss Bingley,"" said Jane, and then read it aloud."
"""MY DEAR FRIEND,--""If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without aquarrel."
Come as soon as you can on receipt of this.
"My brother and thegentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,""CAROLINE BINGLEY""""With the officers!"""
cried Lydia.
"""I wonder my aunt did not tell us of_that_."
"""""Dining out,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""that is very unlucky."
"""""Can I have the carriage?"""
said Jane.
"""No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely torain; and then you must stay all night."
"""""That would be a good scheme,"" said Elizabeth, ""if you were sure thatthey would not offer to send her home.""""Oh!"
"but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."
"""""I had much rather go in the coach."
"""""But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure."
"They arewanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?"
"""""They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."
"""""But if you have got them to-day,"" said Elizabeth, ""my mother's purposewill be answered."
"""She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horseswere engaged."
"Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and hermother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of abad day."
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long beforeit rained hard.
"Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother wasdelighted."
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;Jane certainly could not come back.
"""This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"""
"said Mrs. Bennet more thanonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own."
"Till thenext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of hercontrivance."
"Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfieldbrought the following note for Elizabeth:""MY DEAREST LIZZY,--""I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to beimputed to my getting wet through yesterday."
My kind friends will nothear of my returning till I am better.
"They insist also on my seeing Mr.Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having beento me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much thematter with me.--Yours, etc."
"""""Well, my dear,"" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the notealoud, ""if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if sheshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit ofMr."
"Bingley, and under your orders.""""Oh!"
I am not afraid of her dying.
People do not die of little triflingcolds.
She will be taken good care of.
"As long as she stays there, it isall very well."
I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.
"""Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, thoughthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walkingwas her only alternative."
She declared her resolution.
"""How can you be so silly,"" cried her mother, ""as to think of such athing, in all this dirt!"
You will not be fit to be seen when you getthere.
"""""I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."
"""""Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,"" said her father, ""to send for thehorses?"
"""""No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk."
The distance is nothingwhen one has a motive; only three miles.
I shall be back by dinner.
"""""I admire the activity of your benevolence,"" observed Mary, ""but everyimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
"""""We will go as far as Meryton with you,"" said Catherine and Lydia.Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set offtogether."
"""If we make haste,"" said Lydia, as they walked along, ""perhaps we maysee something of Captain Carter before he goes."
"""In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of oneof the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossingfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springingover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at lastwithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a faceglowing with the warmth of exercise.She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane wereassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in suchdirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it."
"She was received, however, very politely by them; and in theirbrother's manners there was something better than politeness; therewas good humour and kindness."
"Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.Hurst nothing at all."
"The former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt asto the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone."
The latter wasthinking only of his breakfast.Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.
"MissBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and notwell enough to leave her room."
"Elizabeth was glad to be taken to herimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of givingalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longedfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance."
"She was not equal,however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left themtogether, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for theextraordinary kindness she was treated with."
"Elizabeth silently attendedher.When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabethbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection andsolicitude they showed for Jane."
"The apothecary came, and havingexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caughta violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts."
"The advicewas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her headached acutely."
"Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor werethe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, infact, nothing to do elsewhere.When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and veryunwillingly said so."
"Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she onlywanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concernin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offerof the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched toLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supplyof clothes.At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past sixElizabeth was summoned to dinner."
"To the civil inquiries which thenpoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a veryfavourable answer."
Jane was by no means better.
"The sisters, on hearingthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, howshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and theirindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restoredElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency."
"His anxiety for Jane was evident, and hisattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers."
She had very little notice from any but him.
"Miss Bingley wasengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plaindish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room."
"Her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;she had no conversation, no style, no beauty."
"Mrs. Hurst thought thesame, and added:""She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellentwalker."
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.
She reallylooked almost wild.
"""""She did, indeed, Louisa."
I could hardly keep my countenance.
Verynonsensical to come at all!
"Why must _she_ be scampering about thecountry, because her sister had a cold?"
"Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"
"""""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deepin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its office."
"""""Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"" said Bingley; ""but this wasall lost upon me."
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkablywell when she came into the room this morning.
Her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my notice.
"""""_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"" said Miss Bingley; ""and I aminclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make suchan exhibition."
"""""Certainly not."
"""""To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!"
What could she mean byit?
"It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,a most country-town indifference to decorum."
"""""It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,"" saidBingley."
"""I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,"" observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, ""thatthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."
"""""Not at all,"" he replied; ""they were brightened by the exercise."""
"Ashort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:""I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a verysweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled."
"But withsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there isno chance of it."
"""""I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inMeryton."
"""""Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."
"""""That is capital,"" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily."
"""If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,"" cried Bingley, ""itwould not make them one jot less agreeable."
"""""But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world,"" replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friend's vulgar relations.With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room onleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, tilllate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, andwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should godownstairs herself."
"On entering the drawing-room she found the wholeparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspectingthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister theexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow, with a book."
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
"""Do you prefer reading to cards?"""
"said he; ""that is rather singular."
"""""Miss Eliza Bennet,"" said Miss Bingley, ""despises cards."
"She is a greatreader, and has no pleasure in anything else."
"""""I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,"" cried Elizabeth; ""I am_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."
"""""In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,"" said Bingley; ""andI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."
"""Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards thetable where a few books were lying."
He immediately offered to fetch herothers--all that his library afforded.
"""And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have morethan I ever looked into."
"""Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room."
"""I am astonished,"" said Miss Bingley, ""that my father should have leftso small a collection of books."
"What a delightful library you have atPemberley, Mr."
Darcy!
"""""It ought to be good,"" he replied, ""it has been the work of manygenerations."
"""""And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buyingbooks."
"""""I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese.""""Neglect!"
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place.
"Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may behalf as delightful as Pemberley."
"""""I wish it may."
"""""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model."
There is not afiner county in England than Derbyshire.
"""""With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."
"""""I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
"""""Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to getPemberley by purchase than by imitation."
"""Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her verylittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drewnear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and hiseldest sister, to observe the game."
"""Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"""
"said Miss Bingley; ""willshe be as tall as I am?"
"""""I think she will."
"She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, orrather taller."
"""""How I long to see her again!"
I never met with anybody who delighted meso much.
"Such a countenance, such manners!"
And so extremely accomplishedfor her age!
Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.
"""""It is amazing to me,"" said Bingley, ""how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are."
"""""All young ladies accomplished!"
"My dear Charles, what do you mean?"
"""""Yes, all of them, I think."
"They all paint tables, cover screens, andnet purses."
"I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sureI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without beinginformed that she was very accomplished."
"""""Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,"" said Darcy, ""hastoo much truth."
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen.
But I am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.
"Icannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of myacquaintance, that are really accomplished."
"""""Nor I, I am sure,"" said Miss Bingley."
"""Then,"" observed Elizabeth, ""you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman."
"""""Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.""""Oh!"
"certainly,"" cried his faithful assistant, ""no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith."
"A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besidesall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the wordwill be but half-deserved."
"""""All this she must possess,"" added Darcy, ""and to all this she mustyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind byextensive reading."
"""""I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."
"""""Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthis?"
"""""I never saw such a woman."
"I never saw such capacity, and taste, andapplication, and elegance, as you describe united.""Mrs."
"Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward."
"As allconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom."
"""Elizabeth Bennet,"" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,""is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to theother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, itsucceeds."
"But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."
"""""Undoubtedly,"" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,""there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation."
Whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable.
"""Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, andthat she could not leave her."
"Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent forimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians."
"This she would not hear of; but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settledthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennetwere not decidedly better."
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sistersdeclared that they were miserable.
"They solaced their wretchedness,however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better reliefto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters."
"In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form herown judgement of her situation."
"The note was immediately dispatched, andits contents as quickly complied with."
"Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by hertwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have beenvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield."
"Shewould not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carriedhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, thinkit at all advisable."
"After sitting a little while with Jane, on MissBingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour."
Bingley met them with hopesthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
"""Indeed I have, sir,"" was her answer."
"""She is a great deal too ill to bemoved."
Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.
"We must trespassa little longer on your kindness.""""Removed!"""
cried Bingley.
"""It must not be thought of."
"My sister, I amsure, will not hear of her removal."
"""""You may depend upon it, Madam,"" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,""that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while sheremains with us.""Mrs."
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
"""I am sure,"" she added, ""if it was not for such good friends I do notknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffersa vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which isalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetesttemper I have ever met with."
I often tell my other girls they arenothing to _her_.
"You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and acharming prospect over the gravel walk."
I do not know a place in thecountry that is equal to Netherfield.
"You will not think of quitting itin a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."
"""""Whatever I do is done in a hurry,"" replied he; ""and therefore if Ishould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in fiveminutes."
"At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
"""""That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"" said Elizabeth."
"""You begin to comprehend me, do you?"""
"cried he, turning towards her.""Oh!"
yes--I understand you perfectly.
"""""I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seenthrough I am afraid is pitiful."
"""""That is as it happens."
"It does not follow that a deep, intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."
"""""Lizzy,"" cried her mother, ""remember where you are, and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."
"""""I did not know before,"" continued Bingley immediately, ""that you were astudier of character."
It must be an amusing study.
"""""Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing."
They have atleast that advantage.
"""""The country,"" said Darcy, ""can in general supply but a few subjects forsuch a study."
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society.
"""""But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever."
"""""Yes, indeed,"" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioninga country neighbourhood."
"""I assure you there is quite as much of _that_going on in the country as in town."
"""Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,turned silently away."
"Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him, continued her triumph."
"""I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, formy part, except the shops and public places."
"The country is a vast dealpleasanter, is it not, Mr."
Bingley?
"""""When I am in the country,"" he replied, ""I never wish to leave it;and when I am in town it is pretty much the same."
"They have each theiradvantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
"""""Aye--that is because you have the right disposition."
"But thatgentleman,"" looking at Darcy, ""seemed to think the country was nothingat all."
"""""Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,"" said Elizabeth, blushing for hermother."
"""You quite mistook Mr. Darcy."
"He only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,which you must acknowledge to be true."
"""""Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meetingwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger."
I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.
"""Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep hiscountenance."
"His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towardsMr."
Darcy with a very expressive smile.
"Elizabeth, for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her ifCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away."
"""Yes, she called yesterday with her father."
"What an agreeable man SirWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?"
So much the man of fashion!
Sogenteel and easy!
He has always something to say to everybody.
"_That_is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."
"""""Did Charlotte dine with you?"
"""""No, she would go home."
I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.
"Formy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;_my_ daughters are brought up very differently."
"But everybody is tojudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,I assure you."
It is a pity they are not handsome!
Not that I thinkCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.
"""""She seems a very pleasant young woman.""""Oh!"
"dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain."
"Lady Lucas herselfhas often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty."
"I do not like to boastof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybodybetter looking."
It is what everybody says.
I do not trust my ownpartiality.
"When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brotherGardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law wassure he would make her an offer before we came away."
"But, however, hedid not."
Perhaps he thought her too young.
"However, he wrote some verseson her, and very pretty they were."
"""""And so ended his affection,"" said Elizabeth impatiently."
"""There hasbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way."
I wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!
"""""I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,"" said Darcy."
"""Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may."
Everything nourishes what isstrong already.
"But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, Iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
"""Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again."
"She longed tospeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness toJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy."
"Mr. Bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to becivil also, and say what the occasion required."
"She performed her partindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage."
"Upon this signal, the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward."
"The two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that theyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexionand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age."
"She had highanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which theattention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her owneasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance."
"She was veryequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, andabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the mostshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it."
"His answer to thissudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:""I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and whenyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day ofthe ball."
"But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.""Lydia declared herself satisfied."
"""Oh!"
"yes--it would be much better towait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carterwould be at Meryton again."
"And when you have given _your_ ball,"" sheadded, ""I shall insist on their giving one also."
"I shall tell ColonelForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.""Mrs."
"Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returnedinstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to theremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite ofall Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.The day passed much as the day before had done."
"Mrs. Hurst and MissBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, whocontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawing-room."
"The loo-table, however, did not appear.Mr."
"Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watchingthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister."
"Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, andMrs."
"Hurst was observing their game.Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion."
"The perpetualcommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evennessof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and wasexactly in union with her opinion of each."
"""How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"
"""He made no answer."
"""You write uncommonly fast."
"""""You are mistaken."
I write rather slowly.
"""""How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of ayear!"
"Letters of business, too!"
How odious I should think them!
"""""It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."
"""""Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."
"""""I have already told her so once, by your desire."
"""""I am afraid you do not like your pen."
Let me mend it for you.
I mendpens remarkably well.
"""""Thank you--but I always mend my own."
"""""How can you contrive to write so even?"
"""He was silent."
"""Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautifullittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to MissGrantley's."
"""""Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?"
"Atpresent I have not room to do them justice.""""Oh!"
it is of no consequence.
I shall see her in January.
"But do youalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr."
Darcy?
"""""They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for meto determine."
"""""It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter withease, cannot write ill.""""That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,"" cried herbrother, ""because he does _not_ write with ease."
He studies too much forwords of four syllables.
"Do not you, Darcy?"
"""""My style of writing is very different from yours.""""Oh!"""
"cried Miss Bingley, ""Charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable."
"He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."
"""""My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."
"""""Your humility, Mr. Bingley,"" said Elizabeth, ""must disarm reproof."
"""""Nothing is more deceitful,"" said Darcy, ""than the appearance ofhumility."
"It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes anindirect boast."
"""""And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
"""""The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects inwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, youthink at least highly interesting."
"The power of doing anything withquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance."
"When you told Mrs.Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"
"""""Nay,"" cried Bingley, ""this is too much, to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning."
"And yet, upon my honour,I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at thismoment."
"At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies."
"""""I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity."
"Your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you weremounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had betterstay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably notgo--and at another word, might stay a month."
"""""You have only proved by this,"" cried Elizabeth, ""that Mr. Bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition."
You have shown him off now muchmore than he did himself.
"""""I am exceedingly gratified,"" said Bingley, ""by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper."
"But I amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such acircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as Icould."
"""""Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionsas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"
"""""Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak forhimself."
"""""You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,but which I have never acknowledged."
"Allowing the case, however, tostand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, andthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offeringone argument in favour of its propriety."
"""""To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no meritwith you."
"""""To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding ofeither."
"""""You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence offriendship and affection."
"A regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it."
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about Mr. Bingley.
"We may as well wait, perhaps, till thecircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon."
"But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
"""""Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is toappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsistingbetween the parties?"
"""""By all means,"" cried Bingley; ""let us hear all the particulars, notforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have moreweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of."
"I assureyou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison withmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference."
"I declare I do notknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and inparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,when he has nothing to do.""Mr."
"Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh."
"Miss Bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense."
"""I see your design, Bingley,"" said his friend."
"""You dislike an argument,and want to silence this."
"""""Perhaps I do."
Arguments are too much like disputes.
"If you and MissBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be verythankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."
"""""What you ask,"" said Elizabeth, ""is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.Darcy had much better finish his letter.""Mr."
"Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabethfor an indulgence of some music."
"Miss Bingley moved with some alacrityto the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would leadthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, sheseated herself.Mrs."
"Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-booksthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixedon her."
"She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at herbecause he disliked her, was still more strange."
"She could only imagine,however, at last that she drew his notice because there was somethingmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than inany other person present."
The supposition did not pain her.
"She likedhim too little to care for his approbation.After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm bya lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing nearElizabeth, said to her:""Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such anopportunity of dancing a reel?"
"""She smiled, but made no answer."
"He repeated the question, with somesurprise at her silence.""Oh!"""
"said she, ""I heard you before, but I could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply."
"You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I alwaysdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person oftheir premeditated contempt."
"I have, therefore, made up my mind to tellyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me ifyou dare."
"""""Indeed I do not dare."
"""Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at hisgallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcyhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her."
"He reallybelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, heshould be in some danger.Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking oftheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance."
"""I hope,"" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubberythe next day, ""you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when thisdesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running afterofficers."
"And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour tocheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,which your lady possesses."
"""""Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?""""Oh!"
yes.
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placedin the gallery at Pemberley.
Put them next to your great-uncle thejudge.
"They are in the same profession, you know, only in differentlines."
"As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, forwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
"""""It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but theircolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might becopied."
"""At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst andElizabeth herself."
"""I did not know that you intended to walk,"" said Miss Bingley, in someconfusion, lest they had been overheard."
"""You used us abominably ill,"" answered Mrs. Hurst, ""running away withouttelling us that you were coming out."
"""Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walkby herself."
The path just admitted three.
"Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,and immediately said:""This walk is not wide enough for our party."
We had better go into theavenue.
"""But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,laughingly answered:""No, no; stay where you are."
"You are charmingly grouped, and appearto uncommon advantage."
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth.
Good-bye.
"""She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two."
"Jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to hersister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into thedrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with manyprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeableas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.Their powers of conversation were considerable."
"They could describe anentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laughat their acquaintance with spirit.But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps."
"He addressedhimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst alsomade her a slight bow, and said he was ""very glad;"" but diffusenessand warmth remained for Bingley's salutation."
He was full of joy andattention.
"The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest sheshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desireto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further fromthe door."
"He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyoneelse."
"Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with greatdelight.When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of thecard-table--but in vain."
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected.
"She assured him that no one intended to play, andthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her."
"Mr.Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep."
"Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her braceletsand rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with MissBennet.Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and shewas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page."
"Shecould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered herquestion, and read on."
"At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, ""How pleasantit is to spend an evening in this way!"
I declare after all there is noenjoyment like reading!
How much sooner one tires of anything than of abook!
"When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have notan excellent library."
"""No one made any reply."
"She then yawned again, threw aside her book, andcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearingher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenlytowards him and said:""By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance atNetherfield?"
"I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consultthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there arenot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasure."
"""""If you mean Darcy,"" cried her brother, ""he may go to bed, if hechooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settledthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall sendround my cards."
"""""I should like balls infinitely better,"" she replied, ""if they werecarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting."
It would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order ofthe day.
"""""Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not benear so much like a ball."
"""Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walkedabout the room."
"Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; butDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious."
"Inthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,turning to Elizabeth, said:""Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take aturn about the room."
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude.
"""Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately."
Miss Bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy lookedup.
"He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter asElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book."
"He wasdirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere."
"""What could he mean?"
"She was dying to know what could be hismeaning?"""
--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?
"""Not at all,"" was her answer; ""but depend upon it, he means to be severeon us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothingabout it."
"""Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy inanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of histwo motives."
"""I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,"" said he, as soonas she allowed him to speak."
"""You either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secretaffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would becompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much betteras I sit by the fire.""""Oh!"
"shocking!"""
cried Miss Bingley.
"""I never heard anything soabominable."
How shall we punish him for such a speech?
"""""Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,"" said Elizabeth."
"""Wecan all plague and punish one another."
Tease him--laugh at him.
"Intimateas you are, you must know how it is to be done."
"""""But upon my honour, I do _not_."
I do assure you that my intimacy hasnot yet taught me _that_.
Tease calmness of manner and presence ofmind!
"No, no; I feel he may defy us there."
"And as to laughter, we willnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without asubject."
"Mr. Darcy may hug himself.""""Mr."
"Darcy is not to be laughed at!"""
cried Elizabeth.
"""That is anuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it wouldbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances."
I dearly love alaugh.
"""""Miss Bingley,"" said he, ""has given me more credit than can be.The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of theiractions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object inlife is a joke."
"""""Certainly,"" replied Elizabeth--""there are such people, but I hope Iam not one of _them_."
"I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,and I laugh at them whenever I can."
"But these, I suppose, are preciselywhat you are without."
"""""Perhaps that is not possible for anyone."
But it has been the studyof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strongunderstanding to ridicule.
"""""Such as vanity and pride."
"""""Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed."
"But pride--where there is a realsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."
"""Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile."
"""Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,"" said Miss Bingley;""and pray what is the result?"
"""""I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect."
He owns ithimself without disguise.
"""""No,"" said Darcy, ""I have made no such pretension."
"I have faults enough,but they are not, I hope, of understanding."
My temper I dare not vouchfor.
"It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for theconvenience of the world."
"I cannot forget the follies and vices of othersso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself."
My feelingsare not puffed about with every attempt to move them.
My temperwould perhaps be called resentful.
"My good opinion once lost, is lostforever."
"""""_That_ is a failing indeed!"""
cried Elizabeth.
"""Implacable resentment_is_ a shade in a character."
But you have chosen your fault well.
Ireally cannot _laugh_ at it.
You are safe from me.
"""""There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particularevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."
"""""And _your_ defect is to hate everybody."
"""""And yours,"" he replied with a smile, ""is willfully to misunderstandthem."
"""""Do let us have a little music,"" cried Miss Bingley, tired of aconversation in which she had no share."
"""Louisa, you will not mind mywaking Mr."
Hurst?
"""Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte wasopened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry forit."
"He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote thenext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent forthem in the course of the day."
"But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated onher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, whichwould exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receivethem with pleasure before."
"Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, atleast not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home."
"Mrs.Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriagebefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingleyand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare themvery well."
"Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positivelyresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on thecontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to workon Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred."
"Miss Bingley wasthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislikeof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go sosoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not besafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm whereshe felt herself to be right.To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been atNetherfield long enough."
"She attracted him more than he liked--and MissBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admirationshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hopeof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had beensuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weightin confirming or crushing it."
"Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoketen words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they wereat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered mostconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almostall, took place."
"Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at lastvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give herto see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her mosttenderly, she even shook hands with the former."
Elizabeth took leave ofthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.
"Mrs. Bennetwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so muchtrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again."
"But theirfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was reallyglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle."
"Theevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much ofits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane andElizabeth.They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and humannature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations ofthreadbare morality to listen to."
Catherine and Lydia had informationfor them of a different sort.
"Much had been done and much had been saidin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officershad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and ithad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married."
"""I hope, my dear,"" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were atbreakfast the next morning, ""that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."
"""""Who do you mean, my dear?"
"I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinnersare good enough for her."
I do not believe she often sees such at home.
"""""The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.""Mrs."
Bennet's eyes sparkled.
"""A gentleman and a stranger!"
"It is Mr.Bingley, I am sure!"
"Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.Bingley."
But--good Lord!
how unlucky!
There is not a bit of fish to begot to-day.
"Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill thismoment."
"""""It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,"" said her husband; ""it is a person whom Inever saw in the whole course of my life."
"""This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of beingeagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:""About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight agoI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiringearly attention."
"It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.""""Oh!"
"my dear,"" cried his wife, ""I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.Pray do not talk of that odious man."
"I do think it is the hardest thingin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your ownchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long agoto do something or other about it."
"""Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail."
"Theyhad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on whichMrs."
"Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to railbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family offive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about."
"""It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,"" said Mr. Bennet, ""andnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a littlesoftened by his manner of expressing himself."
"""""No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent ofhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical."
I hate such falsefriends.
"Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father didbefore him?"
"""""Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on thathead, as you will hear."
"""""Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October."
"""Dear Sir,--""The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honouredfather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had themisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; butfor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it mightseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyonewith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.Bennet.'"
"--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for havingreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to bedistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine deBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence haspreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall bemy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards herladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies whichare instituted by the Church of England."
"As a clergyman, moreover, Ifeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace inall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds Iflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, andthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estatewill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject theoffered olive-branch."
"I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being themeans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise forit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possibleamends--but of this hereafter."
"If you should have no objection toreceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waitingon you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, andshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennightfollowing, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherineis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, providedthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--Iremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady anddaughters, your well-wisher and friend,""WILLIAM COLLINS""""At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,""said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter."
"""He seems to be a mostconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not willprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us again."
"""""There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and ifhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person todiscourage him."
"""""Though it is difficult,"" said Jane, ""to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to hiscredit."
"""Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for LadyCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and buryinghis parishioners whenever it were required."
"""He must be an oddity, I think,"" said she."
"""I cannot make himout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can hemean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose hewould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?"
"""""No, my dear, I think not."
I have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse.
"There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in hisletter, which promises well."
I am impatient to see him.
"""""In point of composition,"" said Mary, ""the letter does not seemdefective."
"The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet Ithink it is well expressed."
"""To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting."
"It was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour."
"As fortheir mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husband and daughters.Mr."
"Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family."
"Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but theladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither inneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself."
"He was atall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty."
"His air was grave andstately, and his manners were very formal."
"He had not been long seatedbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in thisinstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he didnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage."
"Thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily."
"""You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it mayprove so, for else they will be destitute enough."
Things are settled sooddly.
"""""You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.""""Ah!"
"sir, I do indeed."
"It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, youmust confess."
"Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such thingsI know are all chance in this world."
There is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailed.
"""""I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, andcould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearingforward and precipitate."
But I can assure the young ladies that I comeprepared to admire them.
"At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,when we are better acquainted--""He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on eachother."
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.
"Thehall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet'sheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property."
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; andhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of itscooking was owing.
"But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, whoassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep agood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen."
Hebegged pardon for having displeased her.
"In a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about aquarter of an hour.During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servantswere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness."
"LadyCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration forhis comfort, appeared very remarkable."
Mr. Bennet could not have chosenbetter.
Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.
"The subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspecthe protested that ""he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour ina person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himselfexperienced from Lady Catherine."
She had been graciously pleased toapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her.
"She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening."
"Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by manypeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; shemade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of theneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week ortwo, to visit his relations."
"She had even condescended to advise him tomarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and hadonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectlyapproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafedto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs."
"""""That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""andI dare say she is a very agreeable woman."
It is a pity that great ladiesin general are not more like her.
"Does she live near you, sir?"
"""""The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lanefrom Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."
"""""I think you said she was a widow, sir?"
Has she any family?
"""""She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of veryextensive property.""""Ah!"""
"said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, ""then she is better off thanmany girls."
And what sort of young lady is she?
Is she handsome?
"""""She is a most charming young lady indeed."
"Lady Catherine herself saysthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to thehandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marksthe young lady of distinguished birth."
"She is unfortunately of a sicklyconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in manyaccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I aminformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who stillresides with them."
"But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescendsto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."
"""""Has she been presented?"
I do not remember her name among the ladies atcourt.
"""""Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived theBritish court of its brightest ornament."
Her ladyship seemed pleasedwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion tooffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptableto ladies.
"I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, thather charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the mostelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned byher."
"These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, andit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound topay."
"""""You judge very properly,"" said Mr. Bennet, ""and it is happy for youthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy."
"May I askwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of themoment, or are the result of previous study?"
"""""They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though Isometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegantcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish togive them as unstudied an air as possible.""Mr."
Bennet's expectations were fully answered.
"His cousin was as absurdas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partnerin his pleasure.By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was gladto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies."
"Mr. Collins readilyassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everythingannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, andbegging pardon, protested that he never read novels."
"Kitty stared athim, and Lydia exclaimed."
"Other books were produced, and after somedeliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons."
"Lydia gaped as he opened thevolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read threepages, she interrupted him with:""Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning awayRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him."
My aunt told meso herself on Saturday.
"I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear moreabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."
"""Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:""I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by booksof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit."
"It amazesme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous tothem as instruction."
But I will no longer importune my young cousin.
"""Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist atbackgammon."
"Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he actedvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.Mrs."
"Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia'sinterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he wouldresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore hisyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as anyaffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and preparedfor backgammon.Mr."
"Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature hadbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest partof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate andmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, hehad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any usefulacquaintance."
"The subjection in which his father had brought him up hadgiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now agood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living inretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpectedprosperity."
"A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine deBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect whichhe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as aclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture ofpride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended tomarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he hada wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he foundthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father'sestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility andsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his ownpart.His plan did not vary on seeing them."
"Miss Bennet's lovely faceconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of whatwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settledchoice."
"The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in aquarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, aconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturallyto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it atLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and generalencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on."
"""As toher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she couldnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on herto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.""Mr."
Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soondone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.
"Elizabeth, equallynext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.Mrs."
"Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon havetwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak ofthe day before was now high in her good graces.Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sisterexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followedhim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged withone of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford."
Suchdoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.
"In his library he had beenalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he toldElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of thehouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in theirwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walkerthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of hiscousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton."
The attention ofthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.
"Their eyes wereimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, andnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin ina shop window, could recall them.But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whomthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walkingwith another officer on the other side of the way."
"The officer wasthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia cameto inquire, and he bowed as they passed."
"All were struck with thestranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, underpretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunatelyhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, hadreached the same spot."
"Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreatedpermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned withhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted acommission in their corps."
"This was exactly as it should be; for theyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part ofbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readinessof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct andunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking togethervery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcyand Bingley were seen riding down the street."
"On distinguishing theladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, andbegan the usual civilities."
"Bingley was the principal spokesman, andMiss Bennet the principal object."
"He was then, he said, on his way toLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her."
"Mr. Darcy corroboratedit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyeson Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of thestranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as theylooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red."
"Mr. Wickham,after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy justdeigned to return."
What could be the meaning of it?
"It was impossible toimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed whatpassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.Mr."
Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door ofMr.
"Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia'spressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite ofMrs."
Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding theinvitation.Mrs.
"Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she waseagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, astheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothingabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in thestreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts toNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civilitywas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him."
"Shereceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned withas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previousacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies whointroduced him to her notice."
"Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such anexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soonput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, thatMr."
"Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have alieutenant's commission in the ----shire."
"She had been watching him thelast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued theoccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of theofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become ""stupid,disagreeable fellows."""
"Some of them were to dine with the Phillipsesthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbournwould come in the evening."
"This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillipsprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lotterytickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards."
"The prospect of suchdelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits."
"Mr.Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assuredwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen passbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended eitheror both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explainsuch behaviour than her sister.Mr."
Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiringMrs.
Phillips's manners and politeness.
"He protested that, except LadyCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but evenpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, althoughutterly unknown to her before."
"Something, he supposed, might beattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with somuch attention in the whole course of his life.As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with theiraunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet fora single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coachconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; andthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then inthe house.When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so muchstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared hemight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfastparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey muchgratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him whatRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to thedescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and foundthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt allthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparisonwith the housekeeper's room.In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, andthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until thegentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentivelistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what sheheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours assoon as she could."
"To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examinetheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, theinterval of waiting appeared very long."
"It was over at last, however.The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinkingof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; butMr."
"Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, andwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.Mr."
"Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye wasturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seatedhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell intoconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feelthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be renderedinteresting by the skill of the speaker.With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and theofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the youngladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kindlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantlysupplied with coffee and muffin."
"When the card-tables were placed, hehad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist."
"""I know little of the game at present,"" said he, ""but I shall be gladto improve myself, for in my situation in life--"" Mrs. Phillips was veryglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.Mr."
"Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was hereceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia."
"At first thereseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a mostdetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making betsand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was thereforeat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hearhim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to betold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy."
She dared noteven mention that gentleman.
"Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedlyrelieved."
Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.
"He inquired how farNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked ina hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there."
"""About a month,"" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subjectdrop, added, ""He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, Iunderstand."
"""""Yes,"" replied Mr. Wickham; ""his estate there is a noble one."
A clearten thousand per annum.
"You could not have met with a person morecapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, forI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from myinfancy."
"""Elizabeth could not but look surprised."
"""You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, afterseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meetingyesterday."
Are you much acquainted with Mr.
Darcy?
"""""As much as I ever wish to be,"" cried Elizabeth very warmly."
"""I havespent four days in the same house with him, and I think him verydisagreeable."
"""""I have no right to give _my_ opinion,"" said Wickham, ""as to his beingagreeable or otherwise."
I am not qualified to form one.
I have known himtoo long and too well to be a fair judge.
It is impossible for _me_to be impartial.
But I believe your opinion of him would in generalastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so stronglyanywhere else.
Here you are in your own family.
"""""Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house inthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield."
He is not at all liked inHertfordshire.
Everybody is disgusted with his pride.
You will not findhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.
"""""I cannot pretend to be sorry,"" said Wickham, after a shortinterruption, ""that he or that any man should not be estimated beyondtheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen."
"Theworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by hishigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."
"""""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be anill-tempered man."""
Wickham only shook his head.
"""I wonder,"" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, ""whether he islikely to be in this country much longer."
"""""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when Iwas at Netherfield."
"I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire willnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.""""Oh!"
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.
"If _he_wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go."
"We are not on friendly terms,and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason foravoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a senseof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what heis."
"His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best menthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can neverbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul bya thousand tender recollections."
"His behaviour to myself has beenscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything andeverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing thememory of his father."
"""Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened withall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.Mr."
"Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, theneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all thathe had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but veryintelligible gallantry."
"""It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"" he added,""which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire."
"I knew it to bea most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted mefurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very greatattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.Society, I own, is necessary to me."
"I have been a disappointed man, andmy spirits will not bear solitude."
"I _must_ have employment and society.A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances havenow made it eligible."
"The church _ought_ to have been my profession--Iwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been inpossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman wewere speaking of just now.""""Indeed!"
"""""Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the bestliving in his gift."
"He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.I cannot do justice to his kindness."
"He meant to provide for me amply,and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was givenelsewhere."
"""""Good heavens!"""
"cried Elizabeth; ""but how could _that_ be?"
How could hiswill be disregarded?
Why did you not seek legal redress?
"""""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as togive me no hope from law."
"A man of honour could not have doubted theintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merelyconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claimto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing."
"Certainit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I wasof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and noless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really doneanything to deserve to lose it."
"I have a warm, unguarded temper, andI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely."
I canrecall nothing worse.
"But the fact is, that we are very different sortof men, and that he hates me."
"""""This is quite shocking!"
He deserves to be publicly disgraced.
"""""Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_."
"Till Ican forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."
"""Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer thanever as he expressed them."
"""But what,"" said she, after a pause, ""can have been his motive?"
What canhave induced him to behave so cruelly?
"""""A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot butattribute in some measure to jealousy."
"Had the late Mr. Darcy liked meless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommonattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life."
He hadnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sortof preference which was often given me.
"""""I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never likedhim."
I had not thought so very ill of him.
"I had supposed him to bedespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him ofdescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity asthis."
"""After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, ""I _do_remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability ofhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper."
His dispositionmust be dreadful.
"""""I will not trust myself on the subject,"" replied Wickham; ""I can hardlybe just to him."
"""Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, ""Totreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of hisfather!"""
"She could have added, ""A young man, too, like _you_, whose verycountenance may vouch for your being amiable""--but she contented herselfwith, ""and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"
"""""We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatestpart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care."
"_My_father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be ofuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of thePemberley property."
"He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a mostintimate, confidential friend."
"Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him avoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it tobe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself."
"""""How strange!"""
cried Elizabeth.
"""How abominable!"
I wonder that the verypride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!
"If from no bettermotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--fordishonesty I must call it."
"""""It _is_ wonderful,"" replied Wickham, ""for almost all his actions maybe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend."
It hasconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.
"But we arenone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were strongerimpulses even than pride."
"""""Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?""""Yes."
"It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his moneyfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve thepoor."
"Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of whathis father was--have done this."
"Not to appear to disgrace his family,to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of thePemberley House, is a powerful motive."
"He has also _brotherly_ pride,which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind andcareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried upas the most attentive and best of brothers."
"""""What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"
"""He shook his head."
"""I wish I could call her amiable."
It gives me pain tospeak ill of a Darcy.
"But she is too much like her brother--very, veryproud."
"As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fondof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement."
But she isnothing to me now.
"She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,and, I understand, highly accomplished."
"Since her father's death, herhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends hereducation."
"""After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could nothelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:""I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!"
"How can Mr. Bingley,who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,be in friendship with such a man?"
How can they suit each other?
Do youknow Mr.
Bingley?
"""""Not at all."
"""""He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man."
He cannot know what Mr.Darcy is.
"""""Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses."
He does notwant abilities.
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worthhis while.
"Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he isa very different man from what he is to the less prosperous."
"Hispride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing somethingfor fortune and figure."
"""The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered roundthe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousinElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips."
The usual inquiries as to his success weremade by the latter.
"It had not been very great; he had lost everypoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the leastimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and beggedthat she would not make herself uneasy."
"""I know very well, madam,"" said he, ""that when persons sit down to acard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily Iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object."
"Thereare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to LadyCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle matters.""Mr."
"Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins fora few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh."
"""Lady Catherine de Bourgh,"" she replied, ""has very lately given hima living."
"I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to hernotice, but he certainly has not known her long."
"""""You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcywere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr."
Darcy.
"""""No, indeed, I did not."
I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine'sconnections.
I never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterday.
"""""Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it isbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."
"""This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor MissBingley."
"Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless heraffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were alreadyself-destined for another.""Mr."
"Collins,"" said she, ""speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and herdaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being hispatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
"""""I believe her to be both in a great degree,"" replied Wickham; ""I havenot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never likedher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent."
"She has thereputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believeshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part fromher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for hernephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have anunderstanding of the first class."
"""Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, andthey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supperput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.Wickham's attentions."
"There could be no conversation in the noiseof Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him toeverybody."
"Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, donegracefully."
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.
"She couldthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, allthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his nameas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent."
"Lydiatalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and thefish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. andMrs."
"Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his lossesat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearingthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well managebefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.Wickham and herself."
"Jane listened with astonishment and concern; sheknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham."
"Thepossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough tointerest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to bedone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not beotherwise explained."
"""They have both,"" said she, ""been deceived, I dare say, in some wayor other, of which we can form no idea."
Interested people have perhapsmisrepresented each to the other.
"It is, in short, impossible for us toconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,without actual blame on either side."
"""""Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say onbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in thebusiness?"
"Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill ofsomebody."
"""""Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of myopinion."
"My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful lightit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in sucha manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for."
It isimpossible.
"No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for hischaracter, could be capable of it."
Can his most intimate friends be soexcessively deceived in him?
Oh!
no.
"""""I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, thanthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave melast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony."
"If itbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it."
"Besides, there was truth in hislooks."
"""""It is difficult indeed--it is distressing."
One does not know what tothink.
"""""I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."
"""But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affairbecame public.The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where thisconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they hadbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personalinvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixedfor the following Tuesday."
"The two ladies were delighted to see theirdear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedlyasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation."
"Tothe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennetas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all tothe others."
"They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with anactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as ifeager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to everyfemale of the family."
"Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given incompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flatteredby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of aceremonious card."
"Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in thesociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; andElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's lookand behaviour."
"The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia dependedless on any single event, or any particular person, for though theyeach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ballwas, at any rate, a ball."
And even Mary could assure her family that shehad no disinclination for it.
"""While I can have my mornings to myself,"" said she, ""it is enough--Ithink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of thosewho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable foreverybody."
"""Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she didnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help askinghim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and ifhe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening'samusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained noscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebukeeither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing todance."
"""I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,"" said he, ""that a ballof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancingmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my faircousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity ofsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the rightcause, and not to any disrespect for her."
"""Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in."
She had fully proposed beingengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collinsinstead!
her liveliness had never been worse timed.
"There was no helpfor it, however."
"Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforcedelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with asgood a grace as she could."
She was not the better pleased with hisgallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.
"It now firststruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthyof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form aquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasingcivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at acompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished thangratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long beforeher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriagewas extremely agreeable to _her_."
"Elizabeth, however, did not chooseto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be theconsequence of any reply."
"Mr. Collins might never make the offer, andtill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, theyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at thistime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, therewas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Merytononce."
"No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the veryshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy."
"Even Elizabeth might havefound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended theimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less thana dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, andMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked invain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her."
The certaintyof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections thatmight not unreasonably have alarmed her.
"She had dressed with more thanusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of allthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more thanmight be won in the course of the evening."
"But in an instant arosethe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy'spleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and thoughthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and whotold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business theday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,""I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, ifhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."
"""This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught byElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable forWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, everyfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediatedisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility tothe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham."
"Shewas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned awaywith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even inspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospectof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on herspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she hadnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transitionto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particularnotice."
"The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;they were dances of mortification."
"Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without beingaware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeablepartner for a couple of dances can give."
"The moment of her release fromhim was ecstasy.She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking ofWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked."
"When those danceswere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation withher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who tookher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,without knowing what she did, she accepted him."
"He walked away againimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence ofmind; Charlotte tried to console her:""I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
"""""Heaven forbid!"
_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!
To finda man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
Do not wish me such anevil.
"""When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim herhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be asimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence."
"Elizabeth made noanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to whichshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, andreading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholdingit."
"They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began toimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and atfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it wouldbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she madesome slight observation on the dance."
"He replied, and was againsilent."
"After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second timewith:--""It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy."
"I talkedabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the sizeof the room, or the number of couples."
"""He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should besaid."
"""Very well."
That reply will do for the present.
Perhaps by and by I mayobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.
But_now_ we may be silent.
"""""Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?""""Sometimes."
"One must speak a little, you know."
"It would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possible."
"""""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do youimagine that you are gratifying mine?"
"""""Both,"" replied Elizabeth archly; ""for I have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds."
"We are each of an unsocial,taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down toposterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
"""""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,""said he."
"""How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say."
_You_think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.
"""""I must not decide on my own performance."
"""He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very oftenwalk to Meryton."
"She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resistthe temptation, added, ""When you met us there the other day, we had justbeen forming a new acquaintance."
"""The effect was immediate."
"A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread hisfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herselffor her own weakness, could not go on."
"At length Darcy spoke, and in aconstrained manner said, ""Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy mannersas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of_retaining_ them, is less certain."
"""""He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,"" replied Elizabethwith emphasis, ""and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from allhis life."
"""Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject."
"Atthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him onhis dancing and his partner."
"""I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir."
Such verysuperior dancing is not often seen.
It is evident that you belong to thefirst circles.
"Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does notdisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing ather sister and Bingley) shall take place."
What congratulations will thenflow in!
"I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir."
"Youwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of thatyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."
"""The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but SirWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and hiseyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley andJane, who were dancing together."
"Recovering himself, however, shortly,he turned to his partner, and said, ""Sir William's interruption has mademe forget what we were talking of."
"""""I do not think we were speaking at all."
"Sir William could not haveinterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what weare to talk of next I cannot imagine."
"""""What think you of books?"""
"said he, smiling.""Books--oh!"
no.
"I am sure we never read the same, or not with the samefeelings."
"""""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least beno want of subject."
We may compare our different opinions.
"""""No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full ofsomething else."
"""""The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"""
"said he,with a look of doubt."
"""Yes, always,"" she replied, without knowing what she said, for herthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appearedby her suddenly exclaiming, ""I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created wasunappeasable."
"You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _beingcreated_."
"""""I am,"" said he, with a firm voice."
"""And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"
"""""I hope not."
"""""It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,to be secure of judging properly at first."
"""""May I ask to what these questions tend?"
"""""Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,"" said she, endeavouringto shake off her gravity."
"""I am trying to make it out."
"""""And what is your success?"
"""She shook her head."
"""I do not get on at all."
I hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.
"""""I can readily believe,"" answered he gravely, ""that reports may varygreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you werenot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason tofear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
"""""But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have anotheropportunity."
"""""I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,"" he coldly replied.She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted insilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towardsher, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger againstanother.They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, andwith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:""So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousandquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, amonghis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the lateMr."
Darcy's steward.
"Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not togive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy'susing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he hasalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treatedMr."
Darcy in a most infamous manner.
"I do not know the particulars, butI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that hecannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brotherthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation tothe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himselfout of the way."
"His coming into the country at all is a most insolentthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it."
"I pity you,Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,considering his descent, one could not expect much better."
"""""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"" saidElizabeth angrily; ""for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worsethan of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I canassure you, he informed me himself."
"""""I beg your pardon,"" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer."
"""Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant."
"""""Insolent girl!"""
said Elizabeth to herself.
"""You are much mistakenif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this."
"I seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.Darcy."""
"She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of Bingley."
"Jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude forWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave waybefore the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness."
"""I want to know,"" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than hersister's, ""what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham."
But perhaps you havebeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which caseyou may be sure of my pardon.
"""""No,"" replied Jane, ""I have not forgotten him; but I have nothingsatisfactory to tell you."
"Mr. Bingley does not know the whole ofhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which haveprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced thatMr."
"Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he hasreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,Mr."
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.
"I am afraid he hasbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""""Mr."
Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?
"""""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."
"""""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy."
I amsatisfied.
But what does he say of the living?
"""""He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heardthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left tohim _conditionally_ only."
"""""I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,"" said Elizabeth warmly;""but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only."
"Mr.Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learntthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think ofboth gentlemen as I did before."
"""She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment."
"Elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it."
"On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrewto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her lastpartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate asto make a most important discovery."
"""I have found out,"" said he, ""by a singular accident, that there is nowin the room a near relation of my patroness."
"I happened to overhear thegentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours ofthe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother LadyCatherine."
How wonderfully these sort of things occur!
"Who would havethought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine deBourgh in this assembly!"
"I am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going todo, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before."
My totalignorance of the connection must plead my apology.
"""""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr."
Darcy!
"""""Indeed I am."
I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.
It will be in my power toassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.
"""Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring himthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introductionas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; thatit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior inconsequence, to begin the acquaintance."
"Mr. Collins listened to herwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when sheceased speaking, replied thus:""My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world inyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of yourunderstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a widedifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe thatI consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity withthe highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility ofbehaviour is at the same time maintained."
"You must therefore allow me tofollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me toperform what I look on as a point of duty."
"Pardon me for neglecting toprofit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constantguide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted byeducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a younglady like yourself."""
"And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whoseastonishment at being so addressed was very evident."
"Her cousin prefacedhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word ofit, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips thewords ""apology,"" ""Hunsford,"" and ""Lady Catherine de Bourgh."""
It vexedher to see him expose himself to such a man.
"Mr. Darcy was eyeing himwith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him timeto speak, replied with an air of distant civility."
"Mr. Collins, however,was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemedabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at theend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way."
Mr.Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
"""I have no reason, I assure you,"" said he, ""to be dissatisfied with myreception."
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.
"He answeredme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of sayingthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to becertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily."
It was really a veryhandsome thought.
"Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."
"""As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turnedher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and thetrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane."
"She saw her in idea settled inthat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affectioncould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, ofendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters."
"Her mother's thoughtsshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not toventure near her, lest she might hear too much."
"When they sat down tosupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness whichplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to findthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soonbe married to Mr. Bingley."
"It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennetseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of thematch."
"His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living butthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; andthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were ofJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much asshe could do."
"It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her youngerdaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way ofother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to beable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, thatshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked."
"It wasnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because onsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life."
"Sheconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equallyfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was nochance of it.In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother'swords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audiblewhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that thechief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them."
Hermother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
"""What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?"
I amsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to saynothing _he_ may not like to hear.
"""""For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower."
What advantage can it be for youto offend Mr. Darcy?
You will never recommend yourself to his friend byso doing!
"""Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence."
Her mother wouldtalk of her views in the same intelligible tone.
Elizabeth blushed andblushed again with shame and vexation.
"She could not help frequentlyglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of whatshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she wasconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her."
"The expressionof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed andsteady gravity.At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, whohad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw nolikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham andchicken."
Elizabeth now began to revive.
"But not long was the interval oftranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, andshe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,preparing to oblige the company."
"By many significant looks and silententreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity ofexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song."
"Elizabeth'seyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched herprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was veryill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanksof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on tofavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice wasweak, and her manner affected."
Elizabeth was in agonies.
"She looked atJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking toBingley."
"She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signsof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,imperturbably grave."
"She looked at her father to entreat hisinterference, lest Mary should be singing all night."
"He took the hint,and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, ""That will doextremely well, child."
You have delighted us long enough.
Let the otheryoung ladies have time to exhibit.
"""Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; andElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraidher anxiety had done no good."
Others of the party were now applied to.
"""If I,"" said Mr. Collins, ""were so fortunate as to be able to sing, Ishould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with anair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectlycompatible with the profession of a clergyman."
"I do not mean, however,to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our timeto music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to."
Therector of a parish has much to do.
"In the first place, he must makesuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and notoffensive to his patron."
"He must write his own sermons; and the timethat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the careand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from makingas comfortable as possible."
"And I do not think it of light importancethat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment."
"I cannot acquithim of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit anoccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with thefamily."""
"And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which hadbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room."
"Many stared--manysmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while hiswife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkablyclever, good kind of young man.To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement toexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it wouldhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit orfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sisterthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that hisfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which hemust have witnessed."
"That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, shouldhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of thegentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.The rest of the evening brought her little amusement."
She was teased byMr.
"Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and thoughhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of herpower to dance with others."
"In vain did she entreat him to stand up withsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself toher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to herthe whole evening."
There was no arguing upon such a project.
"She owedher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, andgood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;though often standing within a very short distance of her, quitedisengaged, he never came near enough to speak."
"She felt it to be theprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced init.The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, bya manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter ofan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see howheartily they were wished away by some of the family."
"Mrs. Hurst and hersister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, andwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves."
"They repulsedevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw alanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by thelong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and hissisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality andpoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests."
Darcy saidnothing at all.
"Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.Mr."
"Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from therest, and talked only to each other."
"Elizabeth preserved as steady asilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was toomuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of ""Lord,how tired I am!"""
"accompanied by a violent yawn.When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressinglycivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, andaddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy hewould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, withoutthe ceremony of a formal invitation."
"Bingley was all grateful pleasure,and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting onher, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the nextday for a short time.Mrs."
"Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under thedelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations ofsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedlysee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or fourmonths."
"Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thoughtwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though theman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of eachwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn."
Mr. Collins made hisdeclaration in form.
"Having resolved to do it without loss of time, ashis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and havingno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even atthe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all theobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business."
"Onfinding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:""May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in thecourse of this morning?"
"""Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.Bennet answered instantly, ""Oh dear!--yes--certainly."
I am sure Lizzywill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.
"Come, Kitty, Iwant you up stairs."""
"And, gathering her work together, she was hasteningaway, when Elizabeth called out:""Dear madam, do not go."
I beg you will not go.
Mr. Collins must excuseme.
He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.
I amgoing away myself.
"""""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy."
"I desire you to stay where you are."""
"And uponElizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about toescape, she added: ""Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.Collins."
"""Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment'sconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get itover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried toconceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided betweendistress and diversion."
"Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon asthey were gone, Mr. Collins began."
"""Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far fromdoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections."
"Youwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this littleunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respectedmother's permission for this address."
"You can hardly doubt thepurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you todissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken."
"Almost assoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion ofmy future life."
"But before I am run away with by my feelings on thissubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons formarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the designof selecting a wife, as I certainly did."
"""The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run awaywith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she couldnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,and he continued:""My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing forevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the exampleof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it willadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I oughtto have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice andrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of callingpatroness."
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unaskedtoo!)
"on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before Ileft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson wasarranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr."
"Collins, youmust marry."
A clergyman like you must marry.
"Choose properly, choosea gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a smallincome go a good way."
This is my advice.
"Find such a woman as soon asyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'"
"Allow me, by theway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the noticeand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of theadvantages in my power to offer."
"You will find her manners beyondanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must beacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence andrespect which her rank will inevitably excite."
"Thus much for my generalintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my viewswere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where Ican assure you there are many amiable young women."
"But the fact is, thatbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honouredfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfymyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, thatthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholyevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may notbe for several years."
"This has been my motive, my fair cousin, andI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem."
And now nothingremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of theviolence of my affection.
"To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, andshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am wellaware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand poundsin the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother'sdecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to."
"On that head,therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself thatno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."
"""It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now."
"""You are too hasty, sir,"" she cried."
"""You forget that I have made noanswer."
Let me do it without further loss of time.
Accept my thanks forthe compliment you are paying me.
"I am very sensible of the honour ofyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than todecline them."
"""""I am not now to learn,"" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of thehand, ""that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of theman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for theirfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even athird time."
"I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have justsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."
"""""Upon my word, sir,"" cried Elizabeth, ""your hope is a ratherextraordinary one after my declaration."
I do assure you that I am notone of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are sodaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a secondtime.
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.
"You could not make _me_happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world whocould make you so."
"Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, Iam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for thesituation."
"""""Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,"" said Mr. Collinsvery gravely--""but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at alldisapprove of you."
"And you may be certain when I have the honour ofseeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of yourmodesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."
"""""Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary."
"Youmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the complimentof believing what I say."
"I wish you very happy and very rich, and byrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of yourfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbournestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach."
"This matter maybe considered, therefore, as finally settled."""
"And rising as shethus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thusaddressed her:""When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, Ishall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now givenme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because Iknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man onthe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much toencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of thefemale character."
"""""Really, Mr. Collins,"" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, ""you puzzle meexceedingly."
"If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the formof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way asto convince you of its being one."
"""""You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that yourrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course."
"My reasons forbelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand isunworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer wouldbe any other than highly desirable."
"My situation in life, my connectionswith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, arecircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into furtherconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by nomeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you."
Yourportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undothe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.
"As I musttherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love bysuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."
"""""I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kindof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man."
I wouldrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.
"I thank youagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, butto accept them is absolutely impossible."
My feelings in every respectforbid it.
Can I speak plainer?
"Do not consider me now as an elegantfemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speakingthe truth from her heart."
"""""You are uniformly charming!"""
"cried he, with an air of awkwardgallantry; ""and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the expressauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail ofbeing acceptable."
"""To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would makeno reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, ifhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flatteringencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be utteredin such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least couldnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.Mr."
"Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of hissuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibuleto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth openthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than sheentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself inwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection."
"Mr. Collinsreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and thenproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the resultof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since therefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flowfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have beenglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encouragehim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,and could not help saying so."
"""But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,"" she added, ""that Lizzy shall bebrought to reason."
I will speak to her about it directly.
"She is a veryheadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will_make_ her know it."
"""""Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,"" cried Mr. Collins; ""but ifshe is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she wouldaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, whonaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state."
"If therefore sheactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better notto force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects oftemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."
"""""Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed."
"""Lizzy isonly headstrong in such matters as these."
In everything else she is asgood-natured a girl as ever lived.
"I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, andwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."
"""She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to herhusband, called out as she entered the library, ""Oh!"
"Mr. Bennet, youare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar."
"You must come and makeLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if youdo not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.""Mr."
"Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed themon her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered byher communication."
"""I have not the pleasure of understanding you,"" said he, when she hadfinished her speech."
"""Of what are you talking?"
"""""Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy."
"Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."
"""""And what am I to do on the occasion?"
It seems an hopeless business.
"""""Speak to Lizzy about it yourself."
Tell her that you insist upon hermarrying him.
"""""Let her be called down."
"She shall hear my opinion.""Mrs."
"Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to thelibrary."
"""Come here, child,"" cried her father as she appeared."
"""I have sent foryou on an affair of importance."
I understand that Mr. Collins has madeyou an offer of marriage.
"Is it true?"""
Elizabeth replied that it was.
"""Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"
"""""I have, sir."
"""""Very well."
We now come to the point.
Your mother insists upon youraccepting it.
"Is it not so, Mrs."
Bennet?
"""""Yes, or I will never see her again."
"""""An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth."
From this day you mustbe a stranger to one of your parents.
"Your mother will never see youagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you againif you _do_."
"""Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded theaffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed."
"""What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?"
You promised me to_insist_ upon her marrying him.
"""""My dear,"" replied her husband, ""I have two small favours to request.First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on thepresent occasion; and secondly, of my room."
I shall be glad to have thelibrary to myself as soon as may be.
"""Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, didMrs."
Bennet give up the point.
She talked to Elizabeth again and again;coaxed and threatened her by turns.
"She endeavoured to secure Janein her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declinedinterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, andsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks."
"Though her mannervaried, however, her determination never did.Mr."
"Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousincould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no otherway."
"His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of herdeserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spendthe day with them."
"She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying toher, cried in a half whisper, ""I am glad you are come, for there is suchfun here!"
What do you think has happened this morning?
"Mr. Collins hasmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."
"""Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered thebreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began onthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreatingher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all herfamily."
"""Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,"" she added in a melancholy tone,""for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me."
"I am cruelly used,nobody feels for my poor nerves."
"""Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth."
"""Aye, there she comes,"" continued Mrs. Bennet, ""looking as unconcernedas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, providedshe can have her own way."
"But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take itinto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who isto maintain you when your father is dead."
I shall not be able to keepyou--and so I warn you.
I have done with you from this very day.
"I toldyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,and you will find me as good as my word."
I have no pleasure in talkingto undutiful children.
"Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talkingto anybody."
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can haveno great inclination for talking.
Nobody can tell what I suffer!
But itis always so.
Those who do not complain are never pitied.
"""Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible thatany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase theirritation."
"She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any ofthem, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room withan air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said tothe girls, ""Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, holdyour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversationtogether."
"""Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, butLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries afterherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a littlecuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretendingnot to hear."
"In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projectedconversation: ""Oh!"
Mr.
Collins!
"""""My dear madam,"" replied he, ""let us be for ever silent on this point.Far be it from me,"" he presently continued, in a voice that marked hisdispleasure, ""to resent the behaviour of your daughter."
Resignationto inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of ayoung man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;and I trust I am resigned.
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubtof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect aswhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in ourestimation.
"You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespectto your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions toyour daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet thecompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in mybehalf."
"My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted mydismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own."
But we are allliable to error.
"I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with dueconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."
"""The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, andElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarilyattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of hermother."
"As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chieflyexpressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence."
"He scarcely ever spoketo her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible ofhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whosecivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, andespecially to her friend.The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or illhealth."
Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.
"Elizabethhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan didnot appear in the least affected by it."
"He was always to have gone onSaturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickhamwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to theiraunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, waswell talked over."
"To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledgedthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed."
"""I found,"" said he, ""as the time drew near that I had better not meetMr."
"Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for somany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenesmight arise unpleasant to more than myself."
"""She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a fulldiscussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civillybestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back withthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended toher."
"His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all thecompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as anoccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it camefrom Netherfield."
"The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; andElizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and sawher dwelling intently on some particular passages."
"Jane recollectedherself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usualcheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxietyon the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and nosooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Janeinvited her to follow her up stairs."
"When they had gained their own room,Jane, taking out the letter, said:""This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a gooddeal."
"The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are ontheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again."
Youshall hear what she says.
"""She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the informationof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had ahouse."
"The next was in these words: ""I do not pretend to regret anythingI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of thatdelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile maylessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreservedcorrespondence."
"I depend on you for that."""
"To these highflownexpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she sawnothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that theirabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and asto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease toregard it, in the enjoyment of his."
"""It is unlucky,"" said she, after a short pause, ""that you should not beable to see your friends before they leave the country."
"But may we nothope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looksforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightfulintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greatersatisfaction as sisters?"
Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London bythem.
"""""Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return intoHertfordshire this winter."
"I will read it to you:""""When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business whichtook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as weare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that whenCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we havedetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spendhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel."
"Many of my acquaintances arealready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, mydearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but ofthat I despair."
"I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire mayabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that yourbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of thethree of whom we shall deprive you."
"""""It is evident by this,"" added Jane, ""that he comes back no more thiswinter."
"""""It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_."
"""""Why will you think so?"
It must be his own doing.
He is his ownmaster.
But you do not know _all_.
I _will_ read you the passage whichparticularly hurts me.
"I will have no reserves from _you_.""""Mr."
"Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again."
"I really do not thinkGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened intosomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain ofher being hereafter our sister."
"I do not know whether I ever beforementioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave thecountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem themunreasonable."
"My brother admires her greatly already; he will havefrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister'spartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles mostcapable of engaging any woman's heart."
"With all these circumstances tofavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearestJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happinessof so many?"
"""""What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"""
said Jane as shefinished it.
"""Is it not clear enough?"
"Does it not expressly declare thatCaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she isperfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if shesuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!)"
toput me on my guard?
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?
"""""Yes, there can; for mine is totally different."
Will you hear it?
"""""Most willingly."
"""""You shall have it in a few words."
"Miss Bingley sees that her brother isin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy."
"She follows himto town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that hedoes not care about you."
"""Jane shook her head."
"""Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me."
No one who has ever seen youtogether can doubt his affection.
"Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot."
Sheis not such a simpleton.
"Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes."
"But thecase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and sheis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notionthat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less troublein achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, andI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way."
"But,my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingleytells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallestdegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you onTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, insteadof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."
"""""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"" replied Jane, ""yourrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy."
But I know thefoundation is unjust.
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceivinganyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceivingherself.
"""""That is right."
"You could not have started a more happy idea, since youwill not take comfort in mine."
"Believe her to be deceived, by all means.You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
"""""But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, inaccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marryelsewhere?"
"""""You must decide for yourself,"" said Elizabeth; ""and if, upon maturedeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters ismore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you byall means to refuse him."
"""""How can you talk so?"""
"said Jane, faintly smiling."
"""You must know thatthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I couldnot hesitate."
"""""I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consideryour situation with much compassion."
"""""But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never berequired."
A thousand things may arise in six months!
"""The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmostcontempt."
"It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline'sinterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that thosewishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young manso totally independent of everyone.She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felton the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, thatBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of thefamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happento go away just as they were all getting so intimate together."
"Afterlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and theconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he hadbeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have twofull courses.The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during thechief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her."
"""It keeps him in goodhumour,"" said she, ""and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
"""Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, andthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time."
"This wasvery amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabethhad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure herfrom any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towardsherself."
"Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were sofavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almostsecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so verysoon."
"But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of hischaracter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the nextmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throwhimself at her feet."
"He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail toconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt knowntill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almostsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind."
"Miss Lucasperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, andinstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane."
"But little hadshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and asthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day thatwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation mustbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle withhis happiness."
"The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature mustguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for itscontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pureand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon thatestablishment were gained.Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity."
"Mr. Collins's presentcircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whomthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth wereexceedingly fair."
"Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with moreinterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longerMr."
"Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decidedopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of theLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wifeshould make their appearance at St. James's."
"The whole family, in short,were properly overjoyed on the occasion."
The younger girls formed hopesof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise havedone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte'sdying an old maid.
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.
"She hadgained her point, and had time to consider of it."
Her reflections werein general satisfactory.
"Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensiblenor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her mustbe imaginary."
But still he would be her husband.
"Without thinking highlyeither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it wasthe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantestpreservative from want."
"This preservative she had now obtained; and atthe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt allthe good luck of it."
"The least agreeable circumstance in the businesswas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendshipshe valued beyond that of any other person."
"Elizabeth would wonder,and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to beshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation."
"She resolvedto give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what hadpassed before any of the family."
"A promise of secrecy was of course verydutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for thecuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very directquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he wasat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing topublish his prosperous love.As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of thefamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies movedfor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, wheneverhis engagements might allow him to visit them."
"""My dear madam,"" he replied, ""this invitation is particularlygratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; andyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon aspossible."
"""They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish forso speedy a return, immediately said:""But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, mygood sir?"
You had better neglect your relations than run the risk ofoffending your patroness.
"""""My dear sir,"" replied Mr. Collins, ""I am particularly obliged to youfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking somaterial a step without her ladyship's concurrence."
"""""You cannot be too much upon your guard."
"Risk anything rather than herdispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to usagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."
"""""Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by suchaffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receivefrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of yourregard during my stay in Hertfordshire."
"As for my fair cousins, thoughmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall nowtake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting mycousin Elizabeth."
"""With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equallysurprised that he meditated a quick return."
"Mrs. Bennet wished tounderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of heryounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there wasa solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by nomeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to readand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a veryagreeable companion."
"But on the following morning, every hope of thiskind was done away."
"Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in aprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with herfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; butthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far frompossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment wasconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, andshe could not help crying out:""Engaged to Mr. Collins!"
My dear Charlotte--impossible!
"""The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling herstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct areproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regainedher composure, and calmly replied:""Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?"
"Do you think it incrediblethat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"
"""But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effortfor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect oftheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished herall imaginable happiness."
"""I see what you are feeling,"" replied Charlotte."
"""You must be surprised,very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marryyou."
"But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will besatisfied with what I have done."
"I am not romantic, you know; I neverwas."
"I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins'scharacter, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that mychance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast onentering the marriage state."
"""Elizabeth quietly answered ""Undoubtedly;"" and after an awkward pause,they returned to the rest of the family."
"Charlotte did not stay muchlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of sounsuitable a match."
The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offersof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being nowaccepted.
"She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony wasnot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possiblethat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every betterfeeling to worldly advantage."
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was amost humiliating picture!
"And to the pang of a friend disgracing herselfand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that itwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she hadchosen.Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on whatshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mentionit, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, toannounce her engagement to the family."
"With many compliments to them,and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between thehouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, butincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded andoften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:""Good Lord!"
"Sir William, how can you tell such a story?"
Do not you knowthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?
"""Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have bornewithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carriedhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to thetruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with themost forbearing courtesy.Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasanta situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, bymentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; andendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sistersby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which shewas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on thehappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent characterof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.Mrs."
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal whileSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelingsfound a rapid vent.
"In the first place, she persisted in disbelievingthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collinshad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never behappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off."
"Twoinferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, thatElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that sheherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these twopoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day."
Nothing couldconsole and nothing could appease her.
Nor did that day wear out herresentment.
"A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth withoutscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir Williamor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before shecould at all forgive their daughter.Mr."
"Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and suchas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; forit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he hadbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, andmore foolish than his daughter!Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she saidless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable."
"Kittyand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only aclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of newsto spread at Meryton.Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retorton Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and shecalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have beenenough to drive happiness away.Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept themmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded thatno real confidence could ever subsist between them again."
"Herdisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to hersister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion couldnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of hisreturn.Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was countingthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again."
"The promisedletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed totheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which atwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted."
"After discharginghis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with manyrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affectionof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it wasmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so readyto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whitherhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to takeplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerableargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making himthe happiest of men.Mr."
Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter ofpleasure to Mrs. Bennet.
"On the contrary, she was as much disposed tocomplain of it as her husband."
It was very strange that he should cometo Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenientand exceedingly troublesome.
"She hated having visitors in the housewhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people themost disagreeable."
"Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, andthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continuedabsence.Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject."
"Day afterday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than thereport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more toNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalousfalsehood.Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but thathis sisters would be successful in keeping him away."
"Unwilling asshe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and sodishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent itsfrequently occurring."
"The united efforts of his two unfeeling sistersand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of MissDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, forthe strength of his attachment.As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, morepainful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous ofconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subjectwas never alluded to."
"But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express herimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if hedid not come back she would think herself very ill used."
It neededall Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerabletranquillity.Mr.
"Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but hisreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on hisfirst introduction."
"He was too happy, however, to need much attention;and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved themfrom a great deal of his company."
"The chief of every day was spent byhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in timeto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.Mrs."
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.
"The very mention ofanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of."
The sightof Miss Lucas was odious to her.
"As her successor in that house, sheregarded her with jealous abhorrence."
"Whenever Charlotte came to seethem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; andwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced thatthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herselfand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead."
Shecomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.
"""Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"" said she, ""it is very hard to think that CharlotteLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced tomake way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!"
"""""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts."
Let us hope forbetter things.
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.
"""This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead ofmaking any answer, she went on as before."
"""I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate."
"If it wasnot for the entail, I should not mind it."
"""""What should not you mind?"
"""""I should not mind anything at all."
"""""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of suchinsensibility."
"""""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail."
"Howanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's owndaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"
"""""I leave it to yourself to determine,"" said Mr. Bennet.Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt."
"The very firstsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London forthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having hadtime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he leftthe country.Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the restof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of thewriter, that could give her any comfort."
Miss Darcy's praise occupiedthe chief of it.
"Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Carolineboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predictthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her formerletter."
"She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being aninmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans ofthe latter with regard to new furniture.Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,heard it in silent indignation."
"Her heart was divided between concernfor her sister, and resentment against all others."
To Caroline'sassertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid nocredit.
"That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than shehad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, shecould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easinessof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slaveof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happinessto the caprice of their inclination."
"Had his own happiness, however,been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it inwhatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, asshe thought he must be sensible himself."
"It was a subject, in short,on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing."
"Shecould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had reallydied away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whetherhe had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped hisobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must bematerially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remainedthe same, her peace equally wounded.A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings toElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after alonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she couldnot help saying:""Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!"
She can have noidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.
ButI will not repine.
It cannot last long.
"He will be forgot, and we shallall be as we were before."
"""Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but saidnothing."
"""You doubt me,"" cried Jane, slightly colouring; ""indeed, you haveno reason."
"He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of myacquaintance, but that is all."
"I have nothing either to hope or fear,and nothing to reproach him with."
Thank God!
I have not _that_ pain.
"Alittle time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better."
"""With a stronger voice she soon added, ""I have this comfort immediately,that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that ithas done no harm to anyone but myself."
"""""My dear Jane!"""
"exclaimed Elizabeth, ""you are too good."
Your sweetnessand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to sayto you.
"I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as youdeserve."
"""Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw backthe praise on her sister's warm affection."
"""Nay,"" said Elizabeth, ""this is not fair."
"_You_ wish to think all theworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody."
"I only wantto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it."
"Do notbe afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on yourprivilege of universal good-will."
You need not.
"There are few peoplewhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well."
"The more I seeof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirmsmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of thelittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit orsense."
"I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; theother is Charlotte's marriage."
It is unaccountable!
In every view it isunaccountable!
"""""My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these."
They willruin your happiness.
You do not make allowance enough for differenceof situation and temper.
"Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, andCharlotte's steady, prudent character."
"Remember that she is one of alarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and beready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something likeregard and esteem for our cousin."
"""""To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one elsecould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded thatCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of herunderstanding than I now do of her heart."
"My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is aconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well asI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married himcannot have a proper way of thinking."
"You shall not defend her, thoughit is Charlotte Lucas."
"You shall not, for the sake of one individual,change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuadeyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility ofdanger security for happiness."
"""""I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"" repliedJane; ""and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happytogether."
But enough of this.
You alluded to something else.
Youmentioned _two_ instances.
"I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreatyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, andsaying your opinion of him is sunk."
We must not be so ready to fancyourselves intentionally injured.
We must not expect a lively young manto be always so guarded and circumspect.
It is very often nothing butour own vanity that deceives us.
Women fancy admiration means more thanit does.
"""""And men take care that they should."
"""""If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no ideaof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."
"""""I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,""said Elizabeth; ""but without scheming to do wrong, or to make othersunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery."
"Thoughtlessness,want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,will do the business."
"""""And do you impute it to either of those?"
"""""Yes; to the last."
"But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying whatI think of persons you esteem."
Stop me whilst you can.
"""""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"
"""""Yes, in conjunction with his friend."
"""""I cannot believe it."
Why should they try to influence him?
"They canonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman cansecure it."
"""""Your first position is false."
"They may wish many things besides hishappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; theymay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, greatconnections, and pride."
"""""Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,"" replied Jane;""but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing."
They haveknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they loveher better.
"But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikelythey should have opposed their brother's."
"What sister would thinkherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something veryobjectionable?"
"If they believed him attached to me, they would not tryto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed."
"By supposing such anaffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me mostunhappy."
Do not distress me by the idea.
"I am not ashamed of having beenmistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of whatI should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters."
"Let me take it inthe best light, in the light in which it may be understood."
"""Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley'sname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.Mrs."
"Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning nomore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not accountfor it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it withless perplexity."
"Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what shedid not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely theeffect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw herno more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted atthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day."
Mrs. Bennet's bestcomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.Mr.
Bennet treated the matter differently.
"""So, Lizzy,"" said he one day,""your sister is crossed in love, I find."
I congratulate her.
"Next tobeing married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinctionamong her companions."
When is your turn to come?
You will hardly bear tobe long outdone by Jane.
Now is your time.
Here are officers enough inMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.
Let Wickhambe _your_ man.
"He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."
"""""Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me."
We must notall expect Jane's good fortune.
"""""True,"" said Mr. Bennet, ""but it is a comfort to think that whatever ofthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will makethe most of it.""Mr."
Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloomwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbournfamily.
"They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was nowadded that of general unreserve."
"The whole of what Elizabeth had alreadyheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody waspleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before theyhad known anything of the matter.Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might beany extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the societyof Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded forallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody elseMr."
"Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,Mr."
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival ofSaturday.
"The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on hisside, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reasonto hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day wouldbe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men."
"He took leave of hisrelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his faircousins health and happiness again, and promised their father anotherletter of thanks.On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receivingher brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmasat Longbourn."
"Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatlysuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education."
"The Netherfieldladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who livedby trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been sowell-bred and agreeable."
"Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years youngerthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegantwoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces."
"Between thetwo eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.They had frequently been staying with her in town.The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was todistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions."
When this wasdone she had a less active part to play.
It became her turn to listen.Mrs.
"Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of."
Theyhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.
"Two of hergirls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there wasnothing in it."
"""I do not blame Jane,"" she continued, ""for Jane would have got Mr.Bingley if she could."
But Lizzy!
"Oh, sister!"
"It is very hard to thinkthat she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it notbeen for her own perverseness."
"He made her an offer in this very room,and she refused him."
"The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will havea daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is justas much entailed as ever."
"The Lucases are very artful people indeed,sister."
They are all for what they can get.
"I am sorry to say it ofthem, but so it is."
"It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwartedso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselvesbefore anybody else."
"However, your coming just at this time is thegreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, oflong sleeves.""Mrs."
"Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made hersister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned theconversation.When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject."
"""Itseems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,"" said she."
"""I amsorry it went off."
But these things happen so often!
"A young man, suchas you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girlfor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgetsher, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."
"""""An excellent consolation in its way,"" said Elizabeth, ""but it will notdo for _us_."
We do not suffer by _accident_.
It does not oftenhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man ofindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently inlove with only a few days before.
"""""But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, sodoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea."
"It is asoften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,as to a real, strong attachment."
"Pray, how _violent was_ Mr."
Bingley'slove?
"""""I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quiteinattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her."
"Every timethey met, it was more decided and remarkable."
"At his own ball heoffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and Ispoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer."
Could there befiner symptoms?
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?
"""""Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt."
PoorJane!
"I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not getover it immediately."
"It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; youwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner."
But do you think shewould be prevailed upon to go back with us?
Change of scene might beof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful asanything.
"""Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuadedof her sister's ready acquiescence."
"""I hope,"" added Mrs. Gardiner, ""that no consideration with regard tothis young man will influence her."
"We live in so different a part oftown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we goout so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,unless he really comes to see her."
"""""And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of hisfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in sucha part of London!"
"My dear aunt, how could you think of it?"
"Mr. Darcy mayperhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but hewould hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from itsimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingleynever stirs without him."
"""""So much the better."
I hope they will not meet at all.
But does not Janecorrespond with his sister?
_She_ will not be able to help calling.
"""""She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
"""But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place thispoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's beingwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject whichconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirelyhopeless."
"It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, thathis affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friendssuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane'sattractions.Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and theBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as shehoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger ofseeing him.The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without itsengagement."
"Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainmentof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a familydinner."
"When the engagement was for home, some of the officers alwaysmade part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; andon these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth'swarm commendation, narrowly observed them both."
"Without supposing them,from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preferenceof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; andshe resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she leftHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging suchan attachment.To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,unconnected with his general powers."
"About ten or a dozen years ago,before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that verypart of Derbyshire to which he belonged."
"They had, therefore, manyacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there sincethe death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresherintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way ofprocuring.Mrs."
"Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy bycharacter perfectly well."
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subjectof discourse.
"In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minutedescription which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute ofpraise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting bothhim and herself."
"On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy'streatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman'sreputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, andwas confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. FitzwilliamDarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.Mrs."
"Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly givenon the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; afterhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:""You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely becauseyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speakingopenly."
"Seriously, I would have you be on your guard."
Do not involveyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the wantof fortune would make so very imprudent.
"I have nothing to say against_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune heought to have, I should think you could not do better."
"But as it is, youmust not let your fancy run away with you."
"You have sense, and we allexpect you to use it."
"Your father would depend on _your_ resolution andgood conduct, I am sure."
You must not disappoint your father.
"""""My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."
"""""Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
"""""Well, then, you need not be under any alarm."
"I will take care ofmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too."
"He shall not be in love with me, if Ican prevent it."
"""""Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
"""""I beg your pardon, I will try again."
At present I am not in love withMr.
"Wickham; no, I certainly am not."
"But he is, beyond all comparison,the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached tome--I believe it will be better that he should not."
I see the imprudenceof it.
Oh!
_that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!
"My father's opinion of me doesme the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it."
"Myfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham."
"In short, my dear aunt, Ishould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; butsince we see every day that where there is affection, young peopleare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering intoengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so manyof my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that itwould be wisdom to resist?"
"All that I can promise you, therefore, is notto be in a hurry."
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his firstobject.
"When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing."
"In short,I will do my best."
"""""Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so veryoften."
"At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."
"""""As I did the other day,"" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: ""verytrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_."
But do not imaginethat he is always here so often.
It is on your account that he has beenso frequently invited this week.
You know my mother's ideas as to thenecessity of constant company for her friends.
"But really, and upon myhonour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hopeyou are satisfied."
"""Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her forthe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advicebeing given on such a point, without being resented.Mr."
"Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quittedby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet."
"His marriage wasnow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to thinkit inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, thatshe ""_wished_ they might be happy."""
"Thursday was to be the wedding day,and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when sherose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious andreluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied herout of the room."
"As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:""I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."
"""""_That_ you certainly shall."
"""""And I have another favour to ask you."
Will you come and see me?
"""""We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."
"""""I am not likely to leave Kent for some time."
"Promise me, therefore, tocome to Hunsford."
"""Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in thevisit."
"""My father and Maria are coming to me in March,"" added Charlotte, ""and Ihope you will consent to be of the party."
"Indeed, Eliza, you will be aswelcome as either of them."
"""The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent fromthe church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, onthe subject as usual."
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and theircorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; thatit should be equally unreserved was impossible.
"Elizabeth could neveraddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for thesake of what had been, rather than what was."
"Charlotte's first letterswere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but becuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she wouldlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself tobe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotteexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen."
"Shewrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothingwhich she could not praise."
"The house, furniture, neighbourhood, androads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was mostfriendly and obliging."
"It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford andRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must waitfor her own visit there to know the rest.Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce theirsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped itwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatiencegenerally is."
Jane had been a week in town without either seeing orhearing from Caroline.
"She accounted for it, however, by supposing thather last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident beenlost."
"""My aunt,"" she continued, ""is going to-morrow into that part of thetown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."
"""She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley."
"""I did not think Caroline in spirits,"" were her words, ""but she was veryglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my comingto London."
"I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reachedher."
"I inquired after their brother, of course."
"He was well, but so muchengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him."
I found thatMiss Darcy was expected to dinner.
I wish I could see her.
"My visit wasnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out."
I dare say I shallsee them soon here.
"""Elizabeth shook her head over this letter."
"It convinced her thataccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him."
She endeavoured topersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer beblind to Miss Bingley's inattention.
"After waiting at home every morningfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, thevisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself nolonger."
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister willprove what she felt.
"""My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in herbetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have beenentirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me."
"But, my dear sister,though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if Istill assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence wasas natural as your suspicion."
"I do not at all comprehend her reason forwishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were tohappen again, I am sure I should be deceived again."
"Caroline did notreturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did Ireceive in the meantime."
"When she did come, it was very evident thatshe had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for notcalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and wasin every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I wasperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer."
"I pity,though I cannot help blaming her."
She was very wrong in singling me outas she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began onher side.
"But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been actingwrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is thecause of it."
"I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ knowthis anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easilyaccount for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is tohis sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural andamiable."
"I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she saidherself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if shewanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy."
Icannot understand it.
"If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I shouldbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicityin all this."
"But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and theinvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt."
Let me hear from you verysoon.
"Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfieldagain, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty."
We had betternot mention it.
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accountsfrom our friends at Hunsford.
"Pray go to see them, with Sir William andMaria."
"I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc."
"""This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as sheconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over."
She would noteven wish for a renewal of his attentions.
"His character sunk onevery review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possibleadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantlyregret what he had thrown away.Mrs."
"Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promiseconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabethhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than toherself."
"His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,he was the admirer of some one else."
"Elizabeth was watchful enough tosee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfiedwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortunepermitted it."
"The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the mostremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himselfagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case thanin Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able tosuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she wasready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could verysincerely wish him happy.All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating thecircumstances, she thus went on: ""I am now convinced, my dear aunt, thatI have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pureand elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, andwish him all manner of evil."
But my feelings are not only cordialtowards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.
"I cannot findout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling tothink her a very good sort of girl."
There can be no love in all this.
"Mywatchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a moreinteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in lovewith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly."
Kitty and Lydia takehis defection much more to heart than I do.
"They are young in theways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction thathandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."
"""With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwisediversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty andsometimes cold, did January and February pass away."
March was to takeElizabeth to Hunsford.
"She had not at first thought very seriously ofgoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the planand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasureas well as greater certainty."
"Absence had increased her desire of seeingCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins."
"Therewas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and suchuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little changewas not unwelcome for its own sake."
"The journey would moreover give hera peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would havebeen very sorry for any delay."
"Everything, however, went on smoothly,and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch."
She wasto accompany Sir William and his second daughter.
"The improvementof spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan becameperfect as plan could be.The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that hetold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; onhis side even more."
"His present pursuit could not make him forget thatElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, thefirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his mannerof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her ofwhat she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting theiropinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, therewas a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her tohim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiableand pleasing.Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make herthink him less agreeable."
"Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, agood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to saythat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as muchdelight as the rattle of the chaise."
"Elizabeth loved absurdities, butshe had known Sir William's too long."
"He could tell her nothing new ofthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities wereworn out, like his information.It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so earlyas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon."
"As they drove to Mr. Gardiner'sdoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; whenthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful andlovely as ever."
"On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them towait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seenher for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower."
All was joy andkindness.
"The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle andshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt."
"Their first object was hersister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply toher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support herspirits, there were periods of dejection."
"It was reasonable, however,to hope that they would not continue long."
"Mrs. Gardiner gave her theparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, andrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane andherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up theacquaintance.Mrs."
"Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, andcomplimented her on bearing it so well."
"""But my dear Elizabeth,"" she added, ""what sort of girl is Miss King?"
Ishould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.
"""""Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,between the mercenary and the prudent motive?"
"Where does discretion end,and avarice begin?"
"Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to geta girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he ismercenary."
"""""If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall knowwhat to think."
"""""She is a very good kind of girl, I believe."
I know no harm of her.
"""""But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's deathmade her mistress of this fortune."
"""""No--why should he?"
"If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be formaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equallypoor?"
"""""But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards herso soon after this event."
"""""A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegantdecorums which other people may observe."
"If _she_ does not object to it,why should _we_?"
"""""_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_."
It only shows her beingdeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.
"""""Well,"" cried Elizabeth, ""have it as you choose."
"_He_ shall bemercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."
"""""No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose."
"I should be sorry, you know,to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.""""Oh!"
"if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live inDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are notmuch better."
I am sick of them all.
Thank Heaven!
"I am going to-morrowwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who hasneither manner nor sense to recommend him."
"Stupid men are the only onesworth knowing, after all."
"""""Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."
"""Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had theunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt ina tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer."
"""We have not determined how far it shall carry us,"" said Mrs. Gardiner,""but, perhaps, to the Lakes."
"""No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and heracceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful."
"""Oh, my dear,dear aunt,"" she rapturously cried, ""what delight!"
what felicity!
Yougive me fresh life and vigour.
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.
Whatare young men to rocks and mountains?
Oh!
what hours of transportwe shall spend!
"And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like othertravellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything."
"We_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in ourimaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,will we begin quarreling about its relative situation."
Let _our_first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality oftravellers.
"""Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting toElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she hadseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was insearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side."
Elizabethsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.At length the Parsonage was discernible.
"The garden sloping to theroad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,everything declared they were arriving."
"Mr. Collins and Charlotteappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate whichled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles ofthe whole party."
"In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicingat the sight of each other."
"Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with theliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied withcoming when she found herself so affectionately received."
"She sawinstantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her someminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all herfamily."
"They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out theneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as theywere in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatiousformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife'soffers of refreshment.Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not helpin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, itsaspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him."
"Butthough everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able togratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder ather friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably beashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned hereye on Charlotte."
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; butin general Charlotte wisely did not hear.
"After sitting long enough toadmire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard tothe fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that hadhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in thegarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation ofwhich he attended himself."
"To work in this garden was one of his mostrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenancewith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, andowned she encouraged it as much as possible."
"Here, leading the waythrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them aninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed outwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind."
"He could number thefields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were inthe most distant clump."
"But of all the views which his garden, or whichthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with theprospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that borderedthe park nearly opposite the front of his house."
"It was a handsomemodern building, well situated on rising ground.From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a whitefrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlottetook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband'shelp."
"It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everythingwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of whichElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit."
"When Mr. Collins could beforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and byCharlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be oftenforgotten.She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country."
"Itwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joiningin, observed:""Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherinede Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you willbe delighted with her."
"She is all affability and condescension, and Idoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her noticewhen service is over."
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying shewill include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which shehonours us during your stay here.
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte ischarming.
"We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowedto walk home."
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.
"I_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."
"""""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"" addedCharlotte, ""and a most attentive neighbour."
"""""Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say."
She is the sort ofwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.
"""The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate uponCharlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that itwas all done very well."
"She had also to anticipate how her visitwould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatiousinterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse withRosings."
"A lively imagination soon settled it all.About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting readyfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house inconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody runningup stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her."
"She openedthe door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless withagitation, cried out--""Oh, my dear Eliza!"
"pray make haste and come into the dining-room, forthere is such a sight to be seen!"
I will not tell you what it is.
"Makehaste, and come down this moment."
"""Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, inquest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at thegarden gate."
"""And is this all?"""
cried Elizabeth.
"""I expected at least that the pigswere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and herdaughter.""""La!"
"my dear,"" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, ""it is notLady Catherine."
"The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;the other is Miss de Bourgh."
Only look at her.
She is quite a littlecreature.
Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?
"""""She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.Why does she not come in?"
"""""Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does."
It is the greatest of favourswhen Miss de Bourgh comes in.
"""""I like her appearance,"" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas."
"""Shelooks sickly and cross."
"Yes, she will do for him very well."
"She willmake him a very proper wife.""Mr."
"Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversationwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, wasstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatnessbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked thatway.At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, andthe others returned into the house."
"Mr. Collins no sooner saw the twogirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, whichCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was askedto dine at Rosings the next day.Mr."
"Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wonderingvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and hiswife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunityof doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of LadyCatherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough."
"""I confess,"" said he, ""that I should not have been at all surprised byher ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening atRosings."
"I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that itwould happen."
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
"Whocould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediatelyafter your arrival!"
"""""I am the less surprised at what has happened,"" replied Sir William,""from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, whichmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire."
"About the court, suchinstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."
"""Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but theirvisit to Rosings."
"Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in whatthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, andso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--""Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel."
LadyCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us whichbecomes herself and her daughter.
I would advise you merely to put onwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasionfor anything more.
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of youfor being simply dressed.
She likes to have the distinction of rankpreserved.
"""While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their differentdoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very muchobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner."
"Such formidable accounts ofher ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucaswho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to herintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had doneto his presentation at St. James's.As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half amile across the park."
"Every park has its beauty and its prospects; andElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in suchraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was butslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of thehouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originallycost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was everymoment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.Elizabeth's courage did not fail her."
"She had heard nothing of LadyCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents ormiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thoughtshe could witness without trepidation.From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with arapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, theyfollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where LadyCatherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting."
"Her ladyship,with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins hadsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction shouldbe hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of thoseapologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completelyawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courageenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edgeof her chair, not knowing which way to look."
"Elizabeth found herselfquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before hercomposedly."
"Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-markedfeatures, which might once have been handsome."
"Her air was notconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make hervisitors forget their inferior rank."
"She was not rendered formidable bysilence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately toElizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, shebelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportmentshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on thedaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at herbeing so thin and so small."
There was neither in figure nor face anylikeness between the ladies.
"Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; herfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke verylittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearancethere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listeningto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction beforeher eyes.After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows toadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worthlooking at in the summer.The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants andall the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he hadlikewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by herladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnishnothing greater."
"He carved, and ate, and praised with delightedalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by SirWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-lawsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, andgave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proveda novelty to them."
The party did not supply much conversation.
"Elizabethwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seatedbetween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged inlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her alldinner-time."
"Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how littleMiss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearingshe was indisposed."
"Maria thought speaking out of the question, and thegentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little tobe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without anyintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on everysubject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used tohave her judgement controverted."
"She inquired into Charlotte's domesticconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice asto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to beregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to thecare of her cows and her poultry."
"Elizabeth found that nothing wasbeneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with anoccasion of dictating to others."
"In the intervals of her discoursewith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria andElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knewthe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,pretty kind of girl."
"She asked her, at different times, how many sistersshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any ofthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where theyhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had beenher mother's maiden name?"
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence ofher questions but answered them very composedly.
"Lady Catherine thenobserved,""Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think."
"For yoursake,"" turning to Charlotte, ""I am glad of it; but otherwise I see nooccasion for entailing estates from the female line."
It was not thoughtnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.
"Do you play and sing, MissBennet?"
"""""A little.""""Oh!"
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.
"Ourinstrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try itsome day."
Do your sisters play and sing?
"""""One of them does."
"""""Why did not you all learn?"
You ought all to have learned.
"The MissWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours."
Doyou draw?
"""""No, not at all."
"""""What, none of you?"
"""""Not one."
"""""That is very strange."
But I suppose you had no opportunity.
Your mothershould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.
"""""My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."
"""""Has your governess left you?"
"""""We never had any governess."
"""""No governess!"
How was that possible?
Five daughters brought up at homewithout a governess!
I never heard of such a thing.
Your mother musthave been quite a slave to your education.
"""Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not beenthe case."
"""Then, who taught you?"
who attended to you?
"Without a governess, youmust have been neglected."
"""""Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us aswished to learn never wanted the means."
"We were always encouraged toread, and had all the masters that were necessary."
"Those who chose to beidle, certainly might."
"""""Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I hadknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engageone."
"I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steadyand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it."
It iswonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in thatway.
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.
"Four niecesof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; andit was but the other day that I recommended another young person,who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quitedelighted with her."
"Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf'scalling yesterday to thank me?"
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.
"'LadyCatherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'"
"Are any of youryounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"
"""""Yes, ma'am, all.""""All!"
"What, all five out at once?"
Very odd!
And you only the second.
Theyounger ones out before the elder ones are married!
Your younger sistersmust be very young?
"""""Yes, my youngest is not sixteen."
Perhaps _she_ is full young to bemuch in company.
"But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard uponyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society andamusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination tomarry early."
The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youthas the first.
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!
I think it wouldnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.
"""""Upon my word,"" said her ladyship, ""you give your opinion very decidedlyfor so young a person."
"Pray, what is your age?"
"""""With three younger sisters grown up,"" replied Elizabeth, smiling, ""yourladyship can hardly expect me to own it."
"""Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had everdared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence."
"""You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need notconceal your age."
"""""I am not one-and-twenty."
"""When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tableswere placed."
"Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins satdown to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, thetwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up herparty."
Their table was superlatively stupid.
"Scarcely a syllable wasuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinsonexpressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, orhaving too much or too little light."
A great deal more passed at theother table.
"Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakesof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself."
"Mr. Collinswas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking herfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.Sir William did not say much."
"He was storing his memory with anecdotesand noble names.When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,gratefully accepted and immediately ordered."
The party then gatheredround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they wereto have on the morrow.
From these instructions they were summoned bythe arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed.
"As soonas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousinto give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, forCharlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was."
"But hercommendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfyMr."
"Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praiseinto his own hands.Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was longenough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were notoften met with."
"While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted hismorning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; butwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of hercousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfastand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or inreading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,which fronted the road."
"The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not preferthe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had amore pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellentreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have beenmuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; andshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, andwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages wentalong, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happenedalmost every day."
"She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, andhad a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely everprevailed upon to get out.Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, andnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livingsto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so manyhours."
"Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room duringthese visits."
"She examined into their employments, looked at their work,and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangementof the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if sheaccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of findingout that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not incommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistratein her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to herby Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed tobe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into thevillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scoldthem into harmony and plenty.The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only onecard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpartof the first."
"Their other engagements were few, as the style of livingin the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach."
"This,however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her timecomfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation withCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she hadoften great enjoyment out of doors."
"Her favourite walk, and where shefrequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, wasalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there wasa nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, andwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring anaddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must beimportant."
"Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy wasexpected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were notmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming wouldfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, andshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on himwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidentlydestined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatestsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, andseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen byMiss Lucas and herself.His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walkingthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making hisbow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the greatintelligence."
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay hisrespects.
"There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, forMr."
"Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son ofhis uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, whenMr."
"Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him."
"Charlotte had seenthem from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately runninginto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:""I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility."
Mr. Darcy wouldnever have come so soon to wait upon me.
"""Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortlyafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room."
"Colonel Fitzwilliam,who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person andaddress most truly the gentleman."
"Mr. Darcy looked just as he had beenused to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usualreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward herfriend, met her with every appearance of composure."
"Elizabeth merelycurtseyed to him without saying a word.Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with thereadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; buthis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house andgarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire ofElizabeth after the health of her family."
"She answered him in the usualway, and after a moment's pause, added:""My eldest sister has been in town these three months."
Have you neverhappened to see her there?
"""She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to seewhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed betweenthe Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as heanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet."
"Thesubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards wentaway.Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasuresof their engagements at Rosings."
"It was some days, however, before theyreceived any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in thehouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured bysuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church tocome there in the evening."
For the last week they had seen very littleof Lady Catherine or her daughter.
"Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at theParsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seenonly at church.The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joinedthe party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room."
"Her ladyship receivedthem civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means soacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,much more than to any other person in the room.Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was awelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend hadmoreover caught his fancy very much."
"He now seated himself by her, andtalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and stayingat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half sowell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so muchspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,as well as of Mr. Darcy."
"_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turnedtowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after awhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did notscruple to call out:""What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?"
What is it you are talkingof?
What are you telling Miss Bennet?
Let me hear what it is.
"""""We are speaking of music, madam,"" said he, when no longer able to avoida reply."
"""Of music!"
Then pray speak aloud.
It is of all subjects my delight.
"Imust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoymentof music than myself, or a better natural taste."
"If I had ever learnt,I should have been a great proficient."
"And so would Anne, if her healthhad allowed her to apply."
I am confident that she would have performeddelightfully.
"How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?""Mr."
Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.
"""I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,"" said LadyCatherine; ""and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excelif she does not practice a good deal."
"""""I assure you, madam,"" he replied, ""that she does not need such advice.She practises very constantly."
"""""So much the better."
"It cannot be done too much; and when I next writeto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account."
I oftentell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired withoutconstant practice.
"I have told Miss Bennet several times, that shewill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often toldher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.Jenkinson's room."
"She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that partof the house.""Mr."
"Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and madeno answer.When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of havingpromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument."
Hedrew a chair near her.
"Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and thentalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked awayfrom her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianofortestationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer'scountenance."
"Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the firstconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:""You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hearme?"
I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.
Thereis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at thewill of others.
My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidateme.
"""""I shall not say you are mistaken,"" he replied, ""because you could notreally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I havehad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you findgreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact arenot your own."
"""Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said toColonel Fitzwilliam, ""Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion ofme, and teach you not to believe a word I say."
"I am particularly unluckyin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a partof the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree ofcredit."
"Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention allthat you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave tosay, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and suchthings may come out as will shock your relations to hear."
"""""I am not afraid of you,"" said he, smilingly."
"""Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"" cried ColonelFitzwilliam."
"""I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
"""""You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?"
"He dancedonly four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certainknowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of apartner."
"Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."
"""""I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assemblybeyond my own party."
"""""True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room."
"Well, ColonelFitzwilliam, what do I play next?"
My fingers wait your orders.
"""""Perhaps,"" said Darcy, ""I should have judged better, had I sought anintroduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."
"""""Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"""
"said Elizabeth, stilladdressing Colonel Fitzwilliam."
"""Shall we ask him why a man of sense andeducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommendhimself to strangers?"
"""""I can answer your question,"" said Fitzwilliam, ""without applying tohim."
It is because he will not give himself the trouble.
"""""I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"" said Darcy,""of conversing easily with those I have never seen before."
"I cannotcatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in theirconcerns, as I often see done."
"""""My fingers,"" said Elizabeth, ""do not move over this instrument in themasterly manner which I see so many women's do."
"They have not the sameforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression."
But then Ihave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take thetrouble of practising.
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers ascapable as any other woman's of superior execution.
"""Darcy smiled and said, ""You are perfectly right."
You have employed yourtime much better.
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you canthink anything wanting.
We neither of us perform to strangers.
"""Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to knowwhat they were talking of."
"Elizabeth immediately began playing again.Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, saidto Darcy:""Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, andcould have the advantage of a London master."
"She has a very good notionof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's."
"Anne would havebeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."
"""Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to hiscousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could shediscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Missde Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might havebeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixingwith them many instructions on execution and taste."
"Elizabeth receivedthem with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of thegentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage wasready to take them all home.Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Janewhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of avisitor."
"As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely tobe Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away herhalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, andMr."
"Darcy only, entered the room.He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for hisintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies wereto be within.They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,seemed in danger of sinking into total silence."
"It was absolutelynecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergencerecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, andfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hastydeparture, she observed:""How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see youall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the daybefore."
"He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"
"""""Perfectly so, I thank you."
"""She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a shortpause added:""I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of everreturning to Netherfield again?"
"""""I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spendvery little of his time there in the future."
"He has many friends, andis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continuallyincreasing."
"""""If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better forthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then wemight possibly get a settled family there."
"But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley didnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood asfor his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the sameprinciple."
"""""I should not be surprised,"" said Darcy, ""if he were to give it up assoon as any eligible purchase offers."
"""Elizabeth made no answer."
"She was afraid of talking longer of hisfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave thetrouble of finding a subject to him.He took the hint, and soon began with, ""This seems a very comfortablehouse."
"Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.Collins first came to Hunsford."
"""""I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed herkindness on a more grateful object.""""Mr."
Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
"""""Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with oneof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have madehim happy if they had."
My friend has an excellent understanding--thoughI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as thewisest thing she ever did.
"She seems perfectly happy, however, and in aprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her."
"""""It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy adistance of her own family and friends."
"""""An easy distance, do you call it?"
It is nearly fifty miles.
"""""And what is fifty miles of good road?"
Little more than half a day'sjourney.
"Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."
"""""I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_of the match,"" cried Elizabeth."
"""I should never have said Mrs. Collinswas settled _near_ her family."
"""""It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire."
"Anything beyondthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."
"""As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied sheunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane andNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered:""I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near herfamily."
"The far and the near must be relative, and depend on manyvarying circumstances."
"Where there is fortune to make the expenses oftravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil."
But that is not thecase _here_.
"Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but notsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded myfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_the present distance.""Mr."
"Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, ""_You_ cannothave a right to such very strong local attachment."
_You_ cannot havebeen always at Longbourn.
"""Elizabeth looked surprised."
"The gentleman experienced some change offeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, andglancing over it, said, in a colder voice:""Are you pleased with Kent?"
"""A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either sidecalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotteand her sister, just returned from her walk."
The tete-a-tete surprisedthem.
"Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intrudingon Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without sayingmuch to anybody, went away."
"""What can be the meaning of this?"""
"said Charlotte, as soon as he wasgone."
"""My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would neverhave called us in this familiar way."
"""But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after variousconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed fromthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probablefrom the time of year."
All field sports were over.
"Within doors therewas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannotalways be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or thepleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, thetwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thitheralmost every day."
"They called at various times of the morning, sometimesseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by theiraunt."
"It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because hehad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommendedhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction inbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of herformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she sawthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,she believed he might have the best informed mind.But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficultto understand."
"It could not be for society, as he frequently sat thereten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrificeto propriety, not a pleasure to himself."
He seldom appeared reallyanimated.
Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.
"ColonelFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he wasgenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have toldher; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effectof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herselfseriously to work to find it out."
"She watched him whenever they were atRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success."
"Hecertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of thatlook was disputable."
"It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she oftendoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes itseemed nothing but absence of mind.She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of hisbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger ofraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in heropinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike wouldvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marryingColonel Fitzwilliam."
"He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; hecertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronagein the church, and his cousin could have none at all.More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy."
"She felt all the perverseness of themischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, toprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first thatit was a favourite haunt of hers."
"How it could occur a second time,therefore, was very odd!"
"Yet it did, and even a third."
"It seemed likewilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it wasnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her."
"Henever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talkingor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their thirdrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--abouther pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and heropinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking ofRosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed toexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying_there_ too."
His words seemed to imply it.
Could he have ColonelFitzwilliam in his thoughts?
"She supposed, if he meant anything, he mustmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter."
"It distressedher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in thepales opposite the Parsonage.She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written inspirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she sawon looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her."
"Putting away theletter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:""I did not know before that you ever walked this way."
"""""I have been making the tour of the park,"" he replied, ""as I generallydo every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage."
Areyou going much farther?
"""""No, I should have turned in a moment."
"""And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonagetogether."
"""Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"""
said she.
"""Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again."
But I am at his disposal.
Hearranges the business just as he pleases.
"""""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at leastpleasure in the great power of choice."
I do not know anybody who seemsmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.
Darcy.
"""""He likes to have his own way very well,"" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam."
"""But so we all do."
"It is only that he has better means of having itthan many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor."
I speakfeelingly.
"A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial anddependence."
"""""In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little ofeither."
"Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial anddependence?"
"When have you been prevented by want of money from goingwherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"
"""""These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I haveexperienced many hardships of that nature."
"But in matters of greaterweight, I may suffer from want of money."
Younger sons cannot marry wherethey like.
"""""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very oftendo."
"""""Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not manyin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention tomoney."
"""""Is this,"" thought Elizabeth, ""meant for me?"""
"and she coloured at theidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, ""And pray, whatis the usual price of an earl's younger son?"
"Unless the elder brother isvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."
"""He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped."
"To interrupta silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,she soon afterwards said:""I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake ofhaving someone at his disposal."
"I wonder he does not marry, to secure alasting convenience of that kind."
"But, perhaps, his sister does as wellfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what helikes with her."
"""""No,"" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, ""that is an advantage which he mustdivide with me."
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.
"""""Are you indeed?"
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
Does yourcharge give you much trouble?
"Young ladies of her age are sometimes alittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, shemay like to have her own way."
"""As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the mannerin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely togive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or othergot pretty near the truth."
"She directly replied:""You need not be frightened."
I never heard any harm of her; and I daresay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.
"She is avery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley."
I think I have heard you say that you know them.
"""""I know them a little."
"Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--heis a great friend of Darcy's.""""Oh!"
"yes,"" said Elizabeth drily; ""Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."
"""""Care of him!"
"Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him inthose points where he most wants care."
"From something that he told me inour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted tohim."
"But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose thatBingley was the person meant."
It was all conjecture.
"""""What is it you mean?"
"""""It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be anunpleasant thing."
"""""You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
"""""And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to beBingley."
"What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himselfon having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a mostimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any otherparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believinghim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and fromknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."
"""""Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"
"""""I understood that there were some very strong objections against thelady."
"""""And what arts did he use to separate them?"
"""""He did not talk to me of his own arts,"" said Fitzwilliam, smiling."
"""Heonly told me what I have now told you."
"""Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling withindignation."
"After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why shewas so thoughtful."
"""I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"" said she."
"""Yourcousin's conduct does not suit my feelings."
Why was he to be the judge?
"""""You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"
"""""I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of hisfriend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was todetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.But,"" she continued, recollecting herself, ""as we know none of theparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him."
It is not to be supposedthat there was much affection in the case.
"""""That is not an unnatural surmise,"" said Fitzwilliam, ""but it is alessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."
"""This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a pictureof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, andtherefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferentmatters until they reached the Parsonage."
"There, shut into her own room,as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruptionof all that she had heard."
It was not to be supposed that any otherpeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected.
Therecould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could havesuch boundless influence.
That he had been concerned in the measurestaken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she hadalways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangementof them.
"If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ wasthe cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane hadsuffered, and still continued to suffer."
"He had ruined for a whileevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in theworld; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted."
"""There were some very strong objections against the lady,"" were ColonelFitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, herhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was inbusiness in London."
"""To Jane herself,"" she exclaimed, ""there could be no possibility ofobjection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understandingexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating."
"Neithercould anything be urged against my father, who, though with somepeculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, andrespectability which he will probably never reach."""
"When she thought ofher mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allowthat any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whosepride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want ofimportance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governedby this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.Bingley for his sister.The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on aheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added toher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend hercousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea."
"Mrs. Collins,seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as muchas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collinscould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being ratherdispleased by her staying at home.When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herselfas much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment theexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since herbeing in Kent."
"They contained no actual complaint, nor was there anyrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of thatcheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindlydisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded."
"Elizabethnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with anattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal."
"Mr. Darcy'sshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave hera keener sense of her sister's sufferings."
"It was some consolationto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after thenext--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she shouldherself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery ofher spirits, by all that affection could do.She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering thathis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clearthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did notmean to be unhappy about him.While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of thedoor-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of itsbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late inthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differentlyaffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into theroom."
"In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after herhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.She answered him with cold civility."
"He sat down for a few moments, andthen getting up, walked about the room."
"Elizabeth was surprised, butsaid not a word."
"After a silence of several minutes, he came towards herin an agitated manner, and thus began:""In vain I have struggled."
It will not do.
My feelings will not berepressed.
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and loveyou.
"""Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression."
"She stared, coloured,doubted, and was silent."
"This he considered sufficient encouragement;and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,immediately followed."
He spoke well; but there were feelings besidesthose of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on thesubject of tenderness than of pride.
"His sense of her inferiority--ofits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had alwaysopposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due tothe consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend hissuit.In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible tothe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions didnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was toreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, shelost all compassion in anger."
"She tried, however, to compose herself toanswer him with patience, when he should have done."
"He concluded withrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spiteof all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and withexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance ofhis hand."
"As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubtof a favourable answer."
"He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, buthis countenance expressed real security."
"Such a circumstance couldonly exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into hercheeks, and she said:""In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode toexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, howeverunequally they may be returned."
"It is natural that obligation shouldbe felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you."
"But Icannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainlybestowed it most unwillingly."
I am sorry to have occasioned pain toanyone.
"It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will beof short duration."
"The feelings which, you tell me, have long preventedthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty inovercoming it after this explanation.""Mr."
"Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixedon her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment thansurprise."
"His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbanceof his mind was visible in every feature."
"He was struggling for theappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believedhimself to have attained it."
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelingsdreadful.
"At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:""And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ atcivility, I am thus rejected."
But it is of small importance.
"""""I might as well inquire,"" replied she, ""why with so evident a desireof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked meagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?"
But I haveother provocations.
You know I have.
"Had not my feelings decided againstyou--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do youthink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who hasbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a mostbeloved sister?"
"""As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotionwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while shecontinued:""I have every reason in the world to think ill of you."
No motive canexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.
"You dare not,you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only meansof dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of theworld for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision fordisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutestkind."
"""She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listeningwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity."
"""Can you deny that you have done it?"""
"she repeated.With assumed tranquillity he then replied: ""I have no wish of denyingthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from yoursister, or that I rejoice in my success."
Towards _him_ I have beenkinder than towards myself.
"""Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her."
"""But it is not merely this affair,"" she continued, ""on which my dislikeis founded."
Long before it had taken place my opinion of you wasdecided.
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I receivedmany months ago from Mr. Wickham.
"On this subject, what can you have tosay?"
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?
"""""You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,"" said Darcy,in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour."
"""Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling aninterest in him?"
"""""His misfortunes!"""
"repeated Darcy contemptuously; ""yes, his misfortuneshave been great indeed."
"""""And of your infliction,"" cried Elizabeth with energy."
"""You have reducedhim to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty."
You havewithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed forhim.
You have deprived the best years of his life of that independencewhich was no less his due than his desert.
You have done all this!and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt andridicule.
"""""And this,"" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,""is your opinion of me!"
This is the estimation in which you hold me!I thank you for explaining it so fully.
"My faults, according to thiscalculation, are heavy indeed!"
"But perhaps,"" added he, stopping inhis walk, and turning towards her, ""these offenses might have beenoverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of thescruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design."
"Thesebitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greaterpolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief ofmy being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, byreflection, by everything."
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.
They were natural andjust.
"Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of yourconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whosecondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"
"""Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried tothe utmost to speak with composure when she said:""You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of yourdeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concernwhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a moregentlemanlike manner."
"""She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:""You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way thatwould have tempted me to accept it."
"""Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with anexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification."
"She went on:""From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--ofmy acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullestbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain ofthe feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork ofdisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable adislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were thelast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."
"""""You have said quite enough, madam."
"I perfectly comprehend yourfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my bestwishes for your health and happiness."
"""And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard himthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great."
"She knew not howto support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried forhalf-an-hour."
"Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,was increased by every review of it."
That she should receive an offer ofmarriage from Mr. Darcy!
That he should have been in love with her forso many months!
"So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite ofall the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marryingher sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in hisown case--was almost incredible!"
It was gratifying to have inspiredunconsciously so strong an affection.
"But his pride, his abominablepride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect toJane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he couldnot justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soonovercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had fora moment excited."
"She continued in very agitated reflections till thesound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was toencounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditationswhich had at length closed her eyes."
"She could not yet recover from thesurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anythingelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon afterbreakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise."
"She was proceedingdirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy'ssometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road."
"Thepark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed oneof the gates into the ground.After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she wastempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates andlook into the park."
"The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent hadmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to theverdure of the early trees."
"She was on the point of continuing her walk,when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove whichedged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.Darcy, she was directly retreating."
"But the person who advanced was nownear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronouncedher name."
"She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, thoughin a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards thegate."
"He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,""I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"""
"And then, with aslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, writtenquite through, in a very close hand."
The envelope itself was likewisefull.
"Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it."
"It was datedfrom Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--""Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehensionof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of thoseoffers which were last night so disgusting to you."
"I write without anyintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wisheswhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and theeffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,should have been spared, had not my character required it to be writtenand read."
"You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demandyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but Idemand it of your justice."
"""Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equalmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge."
"The first mentioned was,that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingleyfrom your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of variousclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediateprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham."
"Wilfully andwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledgedfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any otherdependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expectits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two youngpersons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, couldbear no comparison."
"But from the severity of that blame which was lastnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hopeto be in the future secured, when the following account of my actionsand their motives has been read."
"If, in the explanation of them, whichis due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings whichmay be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry."
"The necessitymust be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd."
"""I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common withothers, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other youngwoman in the country."
But it was not till the evening of the danceat Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a seriousattachment.
I had often seen him in love before.
"At that ball, while Ihad the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by SirWilliam Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions toyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone couldbe undecided."
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviourattentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for MissBennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.
Your sister I alsowatched.
"Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convincedfrom the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentionswith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation ofsentiment."
"If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have beenin error."
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latterprobable.
"If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflictpain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable."
"But I shall notscruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance andair was such as might have given the most acute observer a convictionthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to beeasily touched."
That I was desirous of believing her indifferent iscertain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisionsare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.
"I did not believeher to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartialconviction, as truly as I wished it in reason."
"My objections to themarriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to havethe utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want ofconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me."
"Butthere were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though stillexisting, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I hadmyself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately beforeme."
"These causes must be stated, though briefly."
"The situation of yourmother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to thattotal want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed byherself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by yourfather."
Pardon me.
It pains me to offend you.
"But amidst your concernfor the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at thisrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, tohave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, thanit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both."
"I will only sayfarther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all partieswas confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have ledme before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappyconnection."
"He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, asyou, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning."
"""The part which I acted is now to be explained."
"His sisters' uneasinesshad been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling wassoon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost indetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly inLondon."
We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the officeof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.
"Idescribed, and enforced them earnestly."
"But, however this remonstrancemight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not supposethat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not beenseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of yoursister's indifference."
"He had before believed her to return hisaffection with sincere, if not with equal regard."
"But Bingley has greatnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on hisown."
"To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, wasno very difficult point."
"To persuade him against returning intoHertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely thework of a moment."
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.
Thereis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do notreflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt themeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being intown.
"I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but herbrother is even yet ignorant of it."
That they might have met withoutill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to meenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.
"Perhaps thisconcealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and itwas done for the best."
"On this subject I have nothing more to say, noother apology to offer."
"If I have wounded your sister's feelings, itwas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may toyou very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemnthem."
"""With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injuredMr."
"Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of hisconnection with my family."
"Of what he has _particularly_ accused me Iam ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon morethan one witness of undoubted veracity.""Mr."
"Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for manyyears the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose goodconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father tobe of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, hiskindness was therefore liberally bestowed."
"My father supported him atschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as hisown father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would havebeen unable to give him a gentleman's education."
"My father was not onlyfond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; hehad also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would behis profession, intended to provide for him in it."
"As for myself, it ismany, many years since I first began to think of him in a very differentmanner."
"The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he wascareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escapethe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.Darcy could not have."
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degreeyou only can tell.
"But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickhamhas created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me fromunfolding his real character--it adds even another motive."
"""My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment toMr."
"Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularlyrecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best mannerthat his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that avaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant."
Therewas also a legacy of one thousand pounds.
"His own father did not longsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickhamwrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some moreimmediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which hecould not be benefited."
"He had some intention, he added, of studyinglaw, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds wouldbe a very insufficient support therein."
"I rather wished, than believedhim to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede tohis proposal."
"I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; thebusiness was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistancein the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation toreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds."
All connectionbetween us seemed now dissolved.
"I thought too ill of him to invite himto Pemberley, or admit his society in town."
"In town I believe he chieflylived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now freefrom all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of theincumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied tome again by letter for the presentation."
"His circumstances, he assuredme, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad."
"Hehad found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutelyresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living inquestion--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he waswell assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could nothave forgotten my revered father's intentions."
"You will hardly blameme for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting everyrepetition to it."
His resentment was in proportion to the distress ofhis circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of meto others as in his reproaches to myself.
After this period everyappearance of acquaintance was dropped.
How he lived I know not.
Butlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
"""I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfoldto any human being."
"Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of yoursecrecy."
"My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left tothe guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formedfor her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presidedover it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly bydesign; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between himand Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; andby her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness toher as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, andto consent to an elopement."
"She was then but fifteen, which must be herexcuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owedthe knowledge of it to herself."
"I joined them unexpectedly a day or twobefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support theidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to asa father, acknowledged the whole to me."
You may imagine what I felt andhow I acted.
"Regard for my sister's credit and feelings preventedany public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the placeimmediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge."
"Mr.Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, whichis thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope ofrevenging himself on me was a strong inducement."
His revenge would havebeen complete indeed.
"""This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we havebeen concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it asfalse, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.Wickham."
"I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood hehad imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wonderedat."
"Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not inyour inclination."
"""You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; butI was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought tobe revealed."
"For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal moreparticularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from ournear relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one ofthe executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquaintedwith every particular of these transactions."
"If your abhorrence of _me_should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented bythe same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may bethe possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find someopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of themorning."
"I will only add, God bless you."
"""FITZWILLIAM DARCY""If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it tocontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all ofits contents."
"But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerlyshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined."
"With amazement didshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanationto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal."
"With a strongprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of whathad happened at Netherfield."
"She read with an eagerness which hardlyleft her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what thenext sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense ofthe one before her eyes."
"His belief of her sister's insensibility sheinstantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worstobjections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doinghim justice."
"He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfiedher; his style was not penitent, but haughty."
"It was all pride andinsolence.But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--whenshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and whichbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--herfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her."
"She wishedto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ""This must be false!This cannot be!"
"This must be the grossest falsehood!"""
"--and when she hadgone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of thelast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would notregard it, that she would never look in it again.In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest onnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letterwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, sheagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, andcommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly whathe had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, thoughshe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his ownwords."
"So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to thewill, the difference was great."
"What Wickham had said of the livingwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it wasimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or theother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes didnot err."
"But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, theparticulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensionsto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as threethousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate."
"She put downthe letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to beimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but withlittle success."
On both sides it was only assertion.
"Again she readon; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she hadbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as torender Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of aturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay atMr."
"Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she couldbring no proof of its injustice."
"She had never heard of him before hisentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at thepersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,had there renewed a slight acquaintance."
Of his former way of lifenothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.
"Asto his real character, had information been in her power, she hadnever felt a wish of inquiring."
"His countenance, voice, and manner hadestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue."
"She triedto recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait ofintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks ofMr."
"Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for thosecasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcyhad described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance."
Butno such recollection befriended her.
"She could see him instantly beforeher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no moresubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, andthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess."
"Afterpausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued toread."
"But, alas!"
"the story which followed, of his designs on MissDarcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between ColonelFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she wasreferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliamhimself--from whom she had previously received the information of hisnear concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had noreason to question."
"At one time she had almost resolved on applying tohim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, andat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would neverhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of hiscousin's corroboration.She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversationbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory."
"She was _now_struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, andwondered it had escaped her before."
"She saw the indelicacy of puttinghimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professionswith his conduct."
"She remembered that he had boasted of having no fearof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ballthe very next week."
"She remembered also that, till the Netherfieldfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one butherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy'scharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father wouldalways prevent his exposing the son.How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely andhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longerthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he hadeither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifyinghis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had mostincautiously shown."
"Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainterand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could notbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long agoasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive aswere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of theiracquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them muchtogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anythingthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke himof irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he wasesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as abrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of hissister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had hisactions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation ofeverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; andthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable manas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.She grew absolutely ashamed of herself."
"Of neither Darcy nor Wickhamcould she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,absurd."
"""How despicably I have acted!"""
"she cried; ""I, who have prided myselfon my discernment!"
"I, who have valued myself on my abilities!"
"who haveoften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratifiedmy vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!"
How humiliating is thisdiscovery!
"Yet, how just a humiliation!"
"Had I been in love, I couldnot have been more wretchedly blind!"
"But vanity, not love, has been myfolly."
"Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglectof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courtedprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either wereconcerned."
Till this moment I never knew myself.
"""From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a linewhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again."
Widelydifferent was the effect of a second perusal.
"How could she deny thatcredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged togive in the other?"
He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of hersister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte'sopinion had always been.
Neither could she deny the justice of hisdescription of Jane.
"She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, werelittle displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her airand manner not often united with great sensibility.When she came to that part of the letter in which her family werementioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her senseof shame was severe."
"The justice of the charge struck her too forciblyfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded ashaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his firstdisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mindthan on hers.The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt."
"It soothed,but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus beenself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she consideredthat Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearestrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurtby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything shehad ever known before.After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to everyvariety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden andso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, madeher at length return home; and she entered the house with the wishof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing suchreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had eachcalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to takeleave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at leastan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after hertill she could be found."
Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concernin missing him; she really rejoiced at it.
"Colonel Fitzwilliam was nolonger an object; she could think only of her letter.The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins havingbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, wasable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in verygood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after themelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings."
"To Rosings he thenhastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his returnbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous ofhaving them all to dine with her.Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, hadshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her asher future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what herladyship's indignation would have been."
"""What would she have said?"
"howwould she have behaved?"""
were questions with which she amused herself.Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.
"""I assureyou, I feel it exceedingly,"" said Lady Catherine; ""I believe no onefeels the loss of friends so much as I do."
"But I am particularlyattached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached tome!"
They were excessively sorry to go!
But so they always are.
"Thedear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcyseemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year."
"Hisattachment to Rosings certainly increases.""Mr."
"Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, whichwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out ofspirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing thatshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added:""But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg thatyou may stay a little longer."
"Mrs. Collins will be very glad of yourcompany, I am sure."
"""""I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"" repliedElizabeth, ""but it is not in my power to accept it."
I must be in townnext Saturday.
"""""Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks."
I expectedyou to stay two months.
I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.
Therecan be no occasion for your going so soon.
Mrs. Bennet could certainlyspare you for another fortnight.
"""""But my father cannot."
"He wrote last week to hurry my return.""""Oh!"
"your father of course may spare you, if your mother can."
Daughtersare never of so much consequence to a father.
"And if you will stayanother _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you asfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and asDawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good roomfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, Ishould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."
"""""You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by ouroriginal plan."
"""Lady Catherine seemed resigned."
"""Mrs. Collins, you must send a servantwith them."
"You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the ideaof two young women travelling post by themselves."
It is highly improper.You must contrive to send somebody.
I have the greatest dislike inthe world to that sort of thing.
"Young women should always be properlyguarded and attended, according to their situation in life."
"When myniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of herhaving two men-servants go with her."
"Miss Darcy, the daughter ofMr."
"Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared withpropriety in a different manner."
I am excessively attentive to all thosethings.
"You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins."
Iam glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really bediscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.
"""""My uncle is to send a servant for us.""""Oh!"
Your uncle!
"He keeps a man-servant, does he?"
I am very glad youhave somebody who thinks of these things.
Where shall you change horses?Oh!
"Bromley, of course."
"If you mention my name at the Bell, you will beattended to."
"""Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind sooccupied, she might have forgotten where she was."
"Reflection must bereserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to itas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitarywalk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasantrecollections.Mr."
Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.
Shestudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were attimes widely different.
"When she remembered the style of his address,she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustlyshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned againstherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but shecould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again."
"In her own pastbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and inthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.They were hopeless of remedy."
"Her father, contented with laughing atthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of hisyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from rightherself, was entirely insensible of the evil."
"Elizabeth had frequentlyunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherineand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,what chance could there be of improvement?"
"Catherine, weak-spirited,irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been alwaysaffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, wouldscarcely give them a hearing."
"They were ignorant, idle, and vain."
"Whilethere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and whileMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going thereforever.Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy'sexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,heightened the sense of what Jane had lost."
"His affection was provedto have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless anycould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend."
"Howgrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in everyrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane hadbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham'scharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which hadseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make italmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week ofher stay as they had been at first."
"The very last evening was spentthere; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars oftheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only rightway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all thework of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished thema good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out herhand to both.On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a fewminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity ofpaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary."
"""I know not, Miss Elizabeth,"" said he, ""whether Mrs. Collins has yetexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am verycertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks forit."
"The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you."
Weknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.
"Our plainmanner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little wesee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady likeyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spendingyour time unpleasantly."
"""Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness."
"Shehad spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being withCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_feel the obliged."
"Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smilingsolemnity replied:""It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time notdisagreeably."
"We have certainly done our best; and most fortunatelyhaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying thehumble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsfordvisit cannot have been entirely irksome."
Our situation with regard toLady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantageand blessing which few can boast.
You see on what a footing we are.
Yousee how continually we are engaged there.
"In truth I must acknowledgethat, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I shouldnot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they aresharers of our intimacy at Rosings."
"""Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he wasobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civilityand truth in a few short sentences."
"""You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us intoHertfordshire, my dear cousin."
I flatter myself at least that you willbe able to do so.
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins youhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appearthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will beas well to be silent.
"Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity inmarriage."
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way ofthinking.
There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance ofcharacter and ideas between us.
We seem to have been designed for eachother.
"""Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that wasthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believedand rejoiced in his domestic comforts."
"She was not sorry, however, tohave the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.Poor Charlotte!"
it was melancholy to leave her to such society!
"But shehad chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting thather visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion."
"Herhome and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all theirdependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcelsplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready."
"After an affectionateparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage byMr."
"Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning herwith his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanksfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and hiscompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown."
"He then handed herin, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they hadhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings."
"""But,"" he added, ""you will of course wish to have your humble respectsdelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to youwhile you have been here."
"""Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, andthe carriage drove off."
"""Good gracious!"""
"cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, ""it seemsbut a day or two since we first came!"
and yet how many things havehappened!
"""""A great many indeed,"" said her companion with a sigh."
"""We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!How much I shall have to tell!"
"""Elizabeth added privately, ""And how much I shall have to conceal!"
"""Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; andwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner'shouse, where they were to remain a few days.Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying herspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of heraunt had reserved for them."
"But Jane was to go home with her, and atLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even forLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals."
"To knowthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonishJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her ownvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptationto openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecisionin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurriedinto repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sisterfurther.It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set outtogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriagewas to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman'spunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employedin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, anddressing a salad and cucumber.After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table setout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,""Is not this nice?"
Is not this an agreeable surprise?
"""""And we mean to treat you all,"" added Lydia, ""but you must lend us themoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."""
"Then, showingher purchases--""Look here, I have bought this bonnet."
I do not thinkit is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.
"I shallpull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up anybetter."
"""And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfectunconcern, ""Oh!"
"but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; andwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, Ithink it will be very tolerable."
"Besides, it will not much signify whatone wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and theyare going in a fortnight."
"""""Are they indeed!"""
"cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction."
"""They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa totake us all there for the summer!"
It would be such a delicious scheme;and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.
Mamma would like togo too of all things!
Only think what a miserable summer else we shallhave!
"""""Yes,"" thought Elizabeth, ""_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,and completely do for us at once."
Good Heaven!
"Brighton, and a wholecampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poorregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"
"""""Now I have got some news for you,"" said Lydia, as they sat down attable."
"""What do you think?"
It is excellent news--capital news--and abouta certain person we all like!
"""Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he neednot stay."
"Lydia laughed, and said:""Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion."
"You thought thewaiter must not hear, as if he cared!"
I dare say he often hears worsethings said than I am going to say.
But he is an ugly fellow!
I am gladhe is gone.
I never saw such a long chin in my life.
"Well, but now formy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King."
There's for you!
Sheis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.
Wickham is safe.
"""""And Mary King is safe!"""
"added Elizabeth; ""safe from a connectionimprudent as to fortune."
"""""She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."
"""""But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"" said Jane."
"""I am sure there is not on _his_."
"I will answer for it, he never caredthree straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckledthing?"
"""Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of suchcoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage wasordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all theirboxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's andLydia's purchases, were seated in it."
"""How nicely we are all crammed in,"" cried Lydia."
"""I am glad I bought mybonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!"
"Well, nowlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the wayhome."
"And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you allsince you went away."
Have you seen any pleasant men?
Have you had anyflirting?
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husbandbefore you came back.
"Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.She is almost three-and-twenty!"
"Lord, how ashamed I should be of notbeing married before three-and-twenty!"
"My aunt Phillips wants you so toget husbands, you can't think."
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.
Lord!how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I wouldchaperon you about to all the balls.
Dear me!
we had such a good pieceof fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.
"Kitty and me were to spendthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in theevening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!)"
"and soshe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Penwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?"
"Wedressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for alady, only think what fun!"
"Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrowone of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!"
"When Denny,and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, theydid not know him in the least."
Lord!
how I laughed!
and so did Mrs.Forster.
I thought I should have died.
"And _that_ made the men suspectsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter."
"""With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, didLydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse hercompanions all the way to Longbourn."
"Elizabeth listened as little as shecould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.Their reception at home was most kind."
"Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Janein undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennetsay voluntarily to Elizabeth:""I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."
"""Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucasescame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects thatoccupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare andpoultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on onehand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who satsome way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the youngerLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody whowould hear her.""Oh!"
"Mary,"" said she, ""I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended therewas nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kittyhad not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behavedvery handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest coldluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treatedyou too."
And then when we came away it was such fun!
I thought we nevershould have got into the coach.
I was ready to die of laughter.
And thenwe were so merry all the way home!
"we talked and laughed so loud, thatanybody might have heard us ten miles off!"
"""To this Mary very gravely replied, ""Far be it from me, my dear sister,to depreciate such pleasures!"
They would doubtless be congenial with thegenerality of female minds.
But I confess they would have no charms for_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.
"""But of this answer Lydia heard not a word."
"She seldom listened toanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walkto Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadilyopposed the scheme."
It should not be said that the Miss Bennets couldnot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.There was another reason too for her opposition.
"She dreaded seeing Mr.Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible."
Thecomfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyondexpression.
"In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hopedthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brightonscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was underfrequent discussion between her parents."
"Elizabeth saw directly that herfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers wereat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though oftendisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened couldno longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress everyparticular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to besurprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scenebetween Mr. Darcy and herself.Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterlypartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectlynatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings."
She wassorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner solittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for theunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.
"""His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,"" said she, ""and certainlyought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase hisdisappointment!"
"""""Indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, ""I am heartily sorry for him; but he hasother feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
"""""Blame you!"
"Oh, no."
"""""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"
"""""No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
"""""But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very nextday."
"""She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as faras they concerned George Wickham."
"What a stroke was this for poor Jane!who would willingly have gone through the world without believing thatso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was herecollected in one individual."
"Nor was Darcy's vindication, thoughgrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, andseek to clear the one without involving the other."
"""This will not do,"" said Elizabeth; ""you never will be able to make bothof them good for anything."
"Take your choice, but you must be satisfiedwith only one."
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; justenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shiftingabout pretty much.
"For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;but you shall do as you choose."
"""It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane."
"""I do not know when I have been more shocked,"" said she."
"""Wickham sovery bad!"
It is almost past belief.
And poor Mr. Darcy!
"Dear Lizzy, onlyconsider what he must have suffered."
Such a disappointment!
"and with theknowledge of your ill opinion, too!"
and having to relate such a thingof his sister!
It is really too distressing.
"I am sure you must feel itso.""""Oh!"
"no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you sofull of both."
"I know you will do him such ample justice, that I amgrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent."
"Your profusionmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart willbe as light as a feather."
"""""Poor Wickham!"
there is such an expression of goodness in hiscountenance!
such an openness and gentleness in his manner!
"""""There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of thosetwo young men."
"One has got all the goodness, and the other all theappearance of it."
"""""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as youused to do."
"""""And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a disliketo him, without any reason."
"It is such a spur to one's genius, such anopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind."
One may be continuallyabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughingat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.
"""""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treatthe matter as you do now."
"""""Indeed, I could not."
"I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy."
"Andwith no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and saythat I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew Ihad!"
Oh!
how I wanted you!
"""""How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressionsin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear whollyundeserved.""""Certainly."
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a mostnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.
Thereis one point on which I want your advice.
"I want to be told whether Iought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understandWickham's character."
"""Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, ""Surely there can be nooccasion for exposing him so dreadfully."
What is your opinion?
"""""That it ought not to be attempted."
Mr. Darcy has not authorised meto make his communication public.
"On the contrary, every particularrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible tomyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of hisconduct, who will believe me?"
"The general prejudice against Mr. Darcyis so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people inMeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light."
I am not equalto it.
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify toanyone here what he really is.
"Some time hence it will be all found out,and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before."
Atpresent I will say nothing about it.
"""""You are quite right."
To have his errors made public might ruin him forever.
"He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious tore-establish a character."
We must not make him desperate.
"""The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation."
"She hadgot rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wishto talk again of either."
"But there was still something lurking behind,of which prudence forbade the disclosure."
"She dared not relate the otherhalf of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely shehad been valued by her friend."
Here was knowledge in which no onecould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfectunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing offthis last encumbrance of mystery.
"""And then,"" said she, ""if that veryimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able totell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself."
Theliberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!
"""She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the realstate of her sister's spirits."
Jane was not happy.
She still cherished avery tender affection for Bingley.
"Having never even fancied herselfin love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most firstattachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all herattention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check theindulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her ownhealth and their tranquillity."
"""Well, Lizzy,"" said Mrs. Bennet one day, ""what is your opinion _now_ ofthis sad business of Jane's?"
"For my part, I am determined never to speakof it again to anybody."
I told my sister Phillips so the other day.
ButI cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.
"Well, he isa very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the leastchance in the world of her ever getting him now."
"There is no talk ofhis coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired ofeverybody, too, who is likely to know."
"""""I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more."
"""""Oh well!"
it is just as he chooses.
Nobody wants him to come.
"Though Ishall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, Iwould not have put up with it."
"Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane willdie of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done."
"""But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,she made no answer."
"""Well, Lizzy,"" continued her mother, soon afterwards, ""and so theCollinses live very comfortable, do they?"
"Well, well, I only hopeit will last."
And what sort of table do they keep?
"Charlotte is anexcellent manager, I dare say."
"If she is half as sharp as hermother, she is saving enough."
"There is nothing extravagant in _their_housekeeping, I dare say."
"""""No, nothing at all."
"""""A great deal of good management, depend upon it."
"Yes, yes, _they_ willtake care not to outrun their income."
_They_ will never be distressedfor money.
"Well, much good may it do them!"
"And so, I suppose, they oftentalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead."
"They look upon it asquite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."
"""""It was a subject which they could not mention before me."
"""""No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt theyoften talk of it between themselves."
"Well, if they can be easy with anestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better."
I should beashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.
"""The first week of their return was soon gone."
The second began.
"It wasthe last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladiesin the neighbourhood were drooping apace."
The dejection was almostuniversal.
"The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments."
"Veryfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty andLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend suchhard-heartedness in any of the family."
"""Good Heaven!"
what is to become of us?
"What are we to do?"""
would theyoften exclaim in the bitterness of woe.
"""How can you be smiling so,Lizzy?"
"""Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered whatshe had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty yearsago."
"""I am sure,"" said she, ""I cried for two days together when ColonelMiller's regiment went away."
I thought I should have broken my heart.
"""""I am sure I shall break _mine_,"" said Lydia."
"""If one could but go to Brighton!"""
observed Mrs.
Bennet.
"""Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!"
But papa is sodisagreeable.
"""""A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."
"""""And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,""added Kitty.Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually throughLongbourn House."
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all senseof pleasure was lost in shame.
"She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy'sobjections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon hisinterference in the views of his friend.But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for shereceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel ofthe regiment, to accompany her to Brighton."
"This invaluable friend was avery young woman, and very lately married."
"A resemblance in good humourand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out oftheir _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcelyto be described."
"Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydiaflew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone'scongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fatein terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish."
"""I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,""said she, ""Though I am _not_ her particular friend."
"I have just as muchright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."
"""In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to makeher resigned."
"As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far fromexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that sheconsidered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sensefor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were itknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let hergo."
"She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's generalbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship ofsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet moreimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations mustbe greater than at home."
"He heard her attentively, and then said:""Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some publicplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with solittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the presentcircumstances."
"""""If you were aware,"" said Elizabeth, ""of the very great disadvantage tous all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded andimprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure youwould judge differently in the affair."
"""""Already arisen?"""
repeated Mr. Bennet.
"""What, has she frightened awaysome of your lovers?"
Poor little Lizzy!
But do not be cast down.
Suchsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdityare not worth a regret.
"Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows whohave been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."
"""""Indeed you are mistaken."
I have no such injuries to resent.
"It is notof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining."
"Ourimportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by thewild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which markLydia's character."
"Excuse me, for I must speak plainly."
"If you, my dearfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, andof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business ofher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment."
"Her characterwill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirtthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in theworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyondyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptinessof her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universalcontempt which her rage for admiration will excite."
In this dangerKitty also is comprehended.
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.
"Vain,ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!"
Oh!
"my dear father, can yousuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised whereverthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in thedisgrace?""Mr."
"Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, andaffectionately taking her hand said in reply:""Do not make yourself uneasy, my love."
"Wherever you and Jane are knownyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to lessadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very sillysisters."
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go toBrighton.
"Let her go, then."
"Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and willkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be anobject of prey to anybody."
At Brighton she will be of less importanceeven as a common flirt than she has been here.
The officers will findwomen better worth their notice.
"Let us hope, therefore, that her beingthere may teach her her own insignificance."
"At any rate, she cannot growmany degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the restof her life."
"""With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinioncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry."
"It was notin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling onthem."
"She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fretover unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of herdisposition.Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with herfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in theirunited volubility."
"In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprisedevery possibility of earthly happiness."
"She saw, with the creative eyeof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of themat present unknown."
"She saw all the glories of the camp--its tentsstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the youngand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, shesaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least sixofficers at once.Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and suchrealities as these, what would have been her sensations?"
"They could havebeen understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholyconviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their rapturescontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leavinghome.Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time."
"Having beenfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was prettywell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so."
"She had evenlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delightedher, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary."
"In his presentbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions whichhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, afterwhat had since passed, to provoke her."
"She lost all concern for him infinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolousgallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel thereproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatevercause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabethdisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making someinquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, shementioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent threeweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment'srecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seenhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,asked her how she had liked him."
"Her answer was warmly in his favour.With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:""How long did you say he was at Rosings?"
"""""Nearly three weeks."
"""""And you saw him frequently?"
"""""Yes, almost every day."
"""""His manners are very different from his cousin's."
"""""Yes, very different."
"But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.""""Indeed!"""
cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.
"""Andpray, may I ask?--"" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, ""Isit in address that he improves?"
"Has he deigned to add aught of civilityto his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,"" he continued in a lowerand more serious tone, ""that he is improved in essentials."
"""""Oh, no!"""
said Elizabeth.
"""In essentials, I believe, he is very muchwhat he ever was."
"""While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether torejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning."
"There was asomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensiveand anxious attention, while she added:""When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean thathis mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, fromknowing him better, his disposition was better understood."
"""Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitatedlook; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off hisembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest ofaccents:""You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readilycomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assumeeven the _appearance_ of what is right."
"His pride, in that direction,may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must onlydeter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by."
"I onlyfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have beenalluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose goodopinion and judgement he stands much in awe."
"His fear of her has alwaysoperated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to beimputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which Iam certain he has very much at heart."
"""Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by aslight inclination of the head."
"She saw that he wanted to engage her onthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulgehim."
"The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on hisside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguishElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly amutual desire of never meeting again.When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,from whence they were to set out early the next morning."
The separationbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.
Kitty was theonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.
"Mrs.Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss theopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice whichthere was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and inthe clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the moregentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she couldnot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domesticcomfort."
"Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearanceof good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married awoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early intheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her."
"Respect,esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his viewsof domestic happiness were overthrown."
"But Mr. Bennet was not ofa disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his ownimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too oftenconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice."
He was fond ofthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principalenjoyments.
"To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than asher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement."
"This is notthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to hiswife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the truephilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of herfather's behaviour as a husband."
"She had always seen it with pain; butrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment ofherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and tobanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligationand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her ownchildren, was so highly reprehensible."
"But she had never felt sostrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of sounsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arisingfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, evenif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found littleother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment."
"Their partiesabroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother andsister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything aroundthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kittymight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbersof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose dispositiongreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in allher folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as awatering-place and a camp."
"Upon the whole, therefore, she found, whathas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had beenlooking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all thesatisfaction she had promised herself."
"It was consequently necessary toname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to havesome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and byagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for thepresent, and prepare for another disappointment."
"Her tour to the Lakeswas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolationfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her motherand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in thescheme, every part of it would have been perfect."
"""But it is fortunate,"" thought she, ""that I have something to wish for.Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in mysister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations ofpleasure realised."
A scheme of which every part promises delight cannever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off bythe defence of some little peculiar vexation.
"""When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutelyto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, andalways very short."
"Those to her mother contained little else than thatthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officershad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments asmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, whichshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in aviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off tothe camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was stillless to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, weremuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, goodhumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn."
Everything worea happier aspect.
"The families who had been in town for the winter cameback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose."
"Mrs. Bennetwas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle ofJune, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton withouttears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that bythe following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not tomention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and maliciousarrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered inMeryton.The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fastapproaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letterarrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement andcurtailed its extent."
"Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business fromsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London againwithin a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go sofar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it withthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give upthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to thepresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire."
In thatcounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their threeweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.
"Thetown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and wherethey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object ofher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,Dovedale, or the Peak.Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeingthe Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough."
But itwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;and all was soon right again.With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.
It wasimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and itsowner.
"""But surely,"" said she, ""I may enter his county with impunity,and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."
"""The period of expectation was now doubled."
Four weeks were to pass awaybefore her uncle and aunt's arrival.
"But they did pass away, and Mr.and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear atLongbourn."
"The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and twoyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of theircousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense andsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in everyway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off thenext morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bearinconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affectionand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there weredisappointments abroad.It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thitherlay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc."
aresufficiently known.
A small part of Derbyshire is all the presentconcern.
"To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner'sformer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintancestill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all theprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated."
"It was notin their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it."
"Intalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressedan inclination to see the place again."
"Mr. Gardiner declared hiswillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation."
"""My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heardso much?"""
"said her aunt; ""a place, too, with which so many of youracquaintances are connected."
"Wickham passed all his youth there, youknow."
"""Elizabeth was distressed."
"She felt that she had no business atPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it."
"Shemust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over somany, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.Mrs."
Gardiner abused her stupidity.
"""If it were merely a fine houserichly furnished,"" said she, ""I should not care about it myself; butthe grounds are delightful."
They have some of the finest woods in thecountry.
"""Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce."
"Thepossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantlyoccurred."
It would be dreadful!
"She blushed at the very idea, andthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run sucha risk."
"But against this there were objections; and she finally resolvedthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to theabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaidwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place?"
what was the name of itsproprietor?
"and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down forthe summer?"
"A most welcome negative followed the last question--and heralarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal ofcuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived thenext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, andwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any disliketo the scheme."
"To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance ofPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turnedin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground."
"Theyentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time througha beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admiredevery remarkable spot and point of view."
"They gradually ascended forhalf-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerableeminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught byPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into whichthe road with some abruptness wound."
"It was a large, handsome stonebuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge ofhigh woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance wasswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance."
Its bankswere neither formal nor falsely adorned.
Elizabeth was delighted.
"Shehad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where naturalbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste."
"They wereall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt thatto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension ofmeeting its owner returned."
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had beenmistaken.
"On applying to see the place, they were admitted into thehall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure towonder at her being where she was.The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much lessfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her."
Theyfollowed her into the dining-parlour.
"It was a large, well proportionedroom, handsomely fitted up."
"Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, wentto a window to enjoy its prospect."
"The hill, crowned with wood, whichthey had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,was a beautiful object."
"Every disposition of the ground was good; andshe looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on itsbanks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,with delight."
As they passed into other rooms these objects were takingdifferent positions; but from every window there were beauties to beseen.
"The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable tothe fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration ofhis taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less ofsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings."
"""And of this place,"" thought she, ""I might have been mistress!"
Withthese rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
"Instead ofviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, andwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt."
"But no,""--recollectingherself--""that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost tome; I should not have been allowed to invite them."
"""This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very likeregret.She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was reallyabsent, but had not the courage for it."
"At length however, the questionwas asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.Reynolds replied that he was, adding, ""But we expect him to-morrow, witha large party of friends."""
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their ownjourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.
"She approached and saw thelikeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,over the mantelpiece."
"Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a younggentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been broughtup by him at his own expense."
"""He is now gone into the army,"" she added;""but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.""Mrs."
"Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could notreturn it."
"""And that,"" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,""is my master--and very like him."
It was drawn at the same time as theother--about eight years ago.
"""""I have heard much of your master's fine person,"" said Mrs. Gardiner,looking at the picture; ""it is a handsome face."
"But, Lizzy, you can tellus whether it is like or not.""Mrs."
Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on thisintimation of her knowing her master.
"""Does that young lady know Mr."
Darcy?
"""Elizabeth coloured, and said: ""A little."
"""""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"
"""""Yes, very handsome."
"""""I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs youwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this."
"This room was my latemaster's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used tobe then."
He was very fond of them.
"""This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.Mrs."
"Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawnwhen she was only eight years old."
"""And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?"""
said Mrs.
"Gardiner.""Oh!"
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and soaccomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.
"In the next room isa new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; shecomes here to-morrow with him.""Mr."
"Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged hercommunicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, eitherby pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of hermaster and his sister."
"""Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"
"""""Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half histime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."
"""""Except,"" thought Elizabeth, ""when she goes to Ramsgate."
"""""If your master would marry, you might see more of him."
"""""Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be."
"I do not know who isgood enough for him.""Mr."
and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.
"Elizabeth could not help saying, ""It isvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."
"""""I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,""replied the other."
"Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and shelistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, ""I havenever known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him eversince he was four years old."
"""This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to herideas."
"That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and wasgrateful to her uncle for saying:""There are very few people of whom so much can be said."
You are lucky inhaving such a master.
"""""Yes, sir, I know I am."
"If I were to go through the world, I couldnot meet with a better."
"But I have always observed, that they who aregood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; andhe was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in theworld."
"""Elizabeth almost stared at her."
"""Can this be Mr."
"Darcy?"""
thought she.
"""His father was an excellent man,"" said Mrs."
Gardiner.
"""Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--justas affable to the poor."
"""Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more."
Mrs.Reynolds could interest her on no other point.
"She related the subjectsof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of thefurniture, in vain."
"Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of familyprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of hermaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on hismany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase."
"""He is the best landlord, and the best master,"" said she, ""that everlived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing butthemselves."
There is not one of his tenants or servants but will givehim a good name.
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never sawanything of it.
"To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle awaylike other young men."
"""""In what an amiable light does this place him!"""
thought Elizabeth.
"""This fine account of him,"" whispered her aunt as they walked, ""is notquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."
"""""Perhaps we might be deceived."
"""""That is not very likely; our authority was too good."
"""On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very prettysitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness thanthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done togive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room whenlast at Pemberley."
"""He is certainly a good brother,"" said Elizabeth, as she walked towardsone of the windows.Mrs."
"Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enterthe room."
"""And this is always the way with him,"" she added."
"""Whatevercan give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment."
Thereis nothing he would not do for her.
"""The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, wereall that remained to be shown."
"In the former were many good paintings;but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been alreadyvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of MissDarcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, andalso more intelligible.In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could havelittle to fix the attention of a stranger."
Elizabeth walked in quest ofthe only face whose features would be known to her.
"At last it arrestedher--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such asmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when helooked at her."
"She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnestcontemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.Mrs."
"Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father'slifetime.There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentlesensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height oftheir acquaintance."
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynoldswas of no trifling nature.
What praise is more valuable than the praiseof an intelligent servant?
"As a brother, a landlord, a master, sheconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--howmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much ofgood or evil must be done by him!"
"Every idea that had been broughtforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as shestood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed hiseyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment ofgratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, andsoftened its impropriety of expression.When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, wereconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned backto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the formerwas conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himselfsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was hisappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight."
"Their eyesinstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepestblush."
"He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable fromsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at leastof perfect civility.She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to beovercome."
"Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picturethey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other twothat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, onbeholding his master, must immediately have told it."
"They stood a littlealoof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answershe returned to his civil inquiries after her family."
"Amazed at thealteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence thathe uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of theimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the fewminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable inher life."
"Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accenthad none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries asto the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed inDerbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke thedistraction of his thoughts.At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a fewmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and tookleave.The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; butElizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,followed them in silence."
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.
"Hercoming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in theworld!"
How strange it must appear to him!
In what a disgraceful lightmight it not strike so vain a man!
It might seem as if she had purposelythrown herself in his way again!
Oh!
why did she come?
"Or, why did hethus come a day before he was expected?"
"Had they been only ten minutessooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alightedfrom his horse or his carriage."
She blushed again and again overthe perverseness of the meeting.
"And his behaviour, so strikinglyaltered--what could it mean?"
"That he should even speak to her wasamazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, neverhad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting."
"Whata contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he puthis letter into her hand!"
"She knew not what to think, or how to accountfor it.They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, andevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finerreach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some timebefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answeredmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, andseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, shedistinguished no part of the scene."
"Her thoughts were all fixed on thatone spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy thenwas."
"She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--inwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,she was still dear to him."
Perhaps he had been civil only because hefelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which wasnot like ease.
"Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure inseeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her withcomposure.At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mindaroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening ofthe trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of thevalley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreadingmany, and occasionally part of the stream."
"Mr. Gardiner expressed a wishof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; whichbrought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts."
"They crossedit by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and thevalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed thebridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought onlyof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible."
"Her niece was,therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the houseon the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but theirprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge thetaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching theoccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to theman about them, that he advanced but little."
"Whilst wandering on in thisslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishmentwas quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcyapproaching them, and at no great distance."
"The walk being hereless sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him beforethey met."
"Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more preparedfor an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak withcalmness, if he really intended to meet them."
"For a few moments, indeed,she felt that he would probably strike into some other path."
"The idealasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; theturning past, he was immediately before them."
"With a glance, she sawthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate hispoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;but she had not got beyond the words ""delightful,"" and ""charming,"" whensome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise ofPemberley from her might be mischievously construed."
"Her colour changed,and she said no more.Mrs."
"Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he askedher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking theacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride hadrevolted in his offer to herself."
"""What will be his surprise,"" thoughtshe, ""when he knows who they are?"
He takes them now for people offashion.
"""The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named theirrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he boreit, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as hecould from such disgraceful companions."
"That he was _surprised_ by theconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, andso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered intoconversation with Mr. Gardiner."
"Elizabeth could not but be pleased,could not but triumph."
It was consoling that he should know she hadsome relations for whom there was no need to blush.
"She listened mostattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in everyexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,his taste, or his good manners.The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcyinvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as hechose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same timeto supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts ofthe stream where there was usually most sport."
"Mrs. Gardiner, who waswalking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the complimentmust be all for herself."
"Her astonishment, however, was extreme, andcontinually was she repeating, ""Why is he so altered?"
From what canit proceed?
It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that hismanners are thus softened.
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such achange as this.
It is impossible that he should still love me.
"""After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the twogentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending tothe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curiouswater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration."
"It originatedin Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, foundElizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferredher husband's."
"Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked ontogether."
"After a short silence, the lady first spoke."
"She wished himto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to theplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had beenvery unexpected--""for your housekeeper,"" she added, ""informed us thatyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before weleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expectedin the country."""
"He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said thatbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hoursbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling."
"""Theywill join me early to-morrow,"" he continued, ""and among them are somewho will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."
"""Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow."
"Her thoughts were instantlydriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the lastmentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_mind was not very differently engaged."
"""There is also one other person in the party,"" he continued after apause, ""who more particularly wishes to be known to you."
"Will you allowme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintanceduring your stay at Lambton?"
"""The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too greatfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it."
"She immediately feltthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with hermust be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it wassatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not madehim think really ill of her.They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought."
Elizabethwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered andpleased.
His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment ofthe highest kind.
"They soon outstripped the others, and when they hadreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of amile behind.He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself nottired, and they stood together on the lawn."
"At such a time much mighthave been said, and silence was very awkward."
"She wanted to talk, butthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject."
"At last she recollectedthat she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dalewith great perseverance."
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and herpatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete wasover.
"On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to gointo the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, andthey parted on each side with utmost politeness."
"Mr. Darcy handed theladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw himwalking slowly towards the house.The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of thempronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected."
"""He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"" said her uncle."
"""There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,"" replied heraunt, ""but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming."
"I can nowsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, Ihave seen nothing of it."
"""""I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us."
It was morethan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for suchattention.
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.
"""""To be sure, Lizzy,"" said her aunt, ""he is not so handsome as Wickham;or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his featuresare perfectly good."
But how came you to tell me that he was sodisagreeable?
"""Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had likedhim better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had neverseen him so pleasant as this morning."
"""But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"" repliedher uncle."
"""Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take himat his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me offhis grounds."
"""Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, butsaid nothing."
"""From what we have seen of him,"" continued Mrs. Gardiner, ""I reallyshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way byanybody as he has done by poor Wickham."
"He has not an ill-natured look.On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when hespeaks."
And there is something of dignity in his countenance that wouldnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.
"But, to be sure, thegood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes."
"But he is a liberalmaster, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends everyvirtue."
"""Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication ofhis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, inas guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard fromhis relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very differentconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, norWickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire."
"Inconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniarytransactions in which they had been connected, without actually namingher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.Mrs."
"Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were nowapproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way tothe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing outto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think ofanything else."
"Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk theyhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her formeracquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of aintercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabethmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothingbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, aboveall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visither the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequentlyresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after theirarrival at Lambton, these visitors came."
"They had been walking about theplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the innto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of acarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady ina curricle driving up the street."
"Elizabeth immediately recognizingthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of hersurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which sheexpected."
"Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassmentof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and manyof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea onthe business."
"Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt thatthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such aquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece."
"While thesenewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation ofElizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing."
"She was quiteamazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too muchin her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturallysuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walkedup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks ofinquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introductiontook place."
With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her newacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.
"Since herbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she wasonly exceedingly shy."
"She found it difficult to obtain even a word fromher beyond a monosyllable.Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, thoughlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearancewomanly and graceful."
"She was less handsome than her brother; but therewas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectlyunassuming and gentle."
"Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her asacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was muchrelieved by discerning such different feelings.They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingleywas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express hersatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quickstep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room."
"AllElizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she stillfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffectedcordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again."
"Heinquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and lookedand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personagethan to herself."
They had long wished to see him.
"The whole party beforethem, indeed, excited a lively attention."
The suspicions which had justarisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towardseach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew fromthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knewwhat it was to love.
"Of the lady's sensations they remained a littlein doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration wasevident enough.Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do."
"She wanted to ascertain thefeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, andto make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where shefeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom sheendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour."
"Bingleywas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed ina like manner."
"Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than onformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notionthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance."
"But,though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to hisbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane."
No lookappeared on either side that spoke particular regard.
Nothing occurredbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister.
"On this pointshe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurredere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted arecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of sayingmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared."
"He observedto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tonewhich had something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time sincehe had had the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply,he added, ""It is above eight months."
"We have not met since the 26th ofNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."
"""Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwardstook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn."
"There was not much in the question,nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner whichgave them meaning.It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of generalcomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removedfrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her thatthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed howevertemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day."
"Whenshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinionof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been adisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to thevery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their lastlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change wasso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardlyrestrain her astonishment from being visible."
"Never, even in the companyof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relationsat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free fromself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importancecould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even theacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would drawdown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield andRosings.Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they aroseto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressingtheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinnerat Pemberley, before they left the country."
"Miss Darcy, though with adiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,readily obeyed."
"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowinghow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to itsacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head."
"Presuming however,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment thanany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond ofsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage forher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabethagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries tomake after all their Hertfordshire friends."
"Elizabeth, construing allthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and onthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when theirvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with somesatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had beenlittle."
"Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from heruncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear theirfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it wasnot their wish to force her communication."
It was evident that she wasmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;it was evident that he was very much in love with her.
"They saw much tointerest, but nothing to justify inquiry.Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as faras their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find."
"They couldnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his characterfrom their own feelings and his servant's report, without any referenceto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was knownwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy."
"There was now an interest,however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensiblethat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was fouryears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to behastily rejected."
Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence oftheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.
"They hadnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-townwhere the family did not visit."
"It was acknowledged, however, that hewas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not heldthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with theson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-knownfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behindhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more thanthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was notlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out."
Shecertainly did not hate him.
"No; hatred had vanished long ago, and shehad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,that could be so called."
"The respect created by the conviction of hisvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for sometime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightenedinto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly inhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,which yesterday had produced."
"But above all, above respect and esteem,there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance andacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusationsaccompanying her rejection."
"He who, she had been persuaded, would avoidher as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, mosteager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate displayof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves onlywere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and benton making her known to his sister."
"Such a change in a man of so muchpride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardentlove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of asort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not beexactly defined."
"She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know howfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it wouldbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which herfancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal ofhis addresses.It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, thatsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on thevery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to alate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, thatit would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the followingmorning."
"They were, therefore, to go."
"Elizabeth was pleased; though whenshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.Mr."
Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.
"The fishing scheme had beenrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meetingsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her hadoriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome herappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with howmuch civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer."
"Its windowsopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woodyhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnutswhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting therewith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived inLondon."
"Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended withall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fearof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferiorthe belief of her being proud and reserved."
"Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,however, did her justice, and pitied her.By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,succeeded for a few moments."
"It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, agenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kindof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of theothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help fromElizabeth, the conversation was carried on."
"Miss Darcy looked as if shewished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture ashort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, withoutcalling her attention."
"This observation would not have prevented herfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at aninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessityof saying much."
Her own thoughts were employing her.
She expected everymoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.
"She wished, shefeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whethershe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine."
"Aftersitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing MissBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a coldinquiry after the health of her family."
"She answered with equalindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by theentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all thefinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after manya significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had beengiven, to remind her of her post."
"There was now employment for the wholeparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and thebeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collectedthem round the table.While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whethershe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by thefeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though buta moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began toregret that he came.He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three othergentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left himonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit toGeorgiana that morning."
"No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wiselyresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the morenecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because shesaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviourwhen he first came into the room."
"In no countenance was attentivecuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of thesmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of itsobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentionsto Mr. Darcy were by no means over."
"Miss Darcy, on her brother'sentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that hewas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwardedas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side."
"MissBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took thefirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:""Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?They must be a great loss to _your_ family."
"""In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabethinstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and thevarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, shepresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone."
"Whileshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightenedcomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome withconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes."
"Had Miss Bingley known whatpain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly wouldhave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discomposeElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believedher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her inDarcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the folliesand absurdities by which some part of her family were connectedwith that corps."
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy'smeditated elopement.
"To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecywas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connectionsher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the verywish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becominghereafter her own."
"He had certainly formed such a plan, and withoutmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from MissBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concernfor the welfare of his friend.Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; andas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer toWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be ableto speak any more."
"Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcelyrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance whichhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to havefixed them on her more and more cheerfully.Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer abovementioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage MissBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,behaviour, and dress."
But Georgiana would not join her.
Her brother'srecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could noterr.
And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgianawithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.
"WhenDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating tohim some part of what she had been saying to his sister."
"""How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"" shecried; ""I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is sincethe winter."
She is grown so brown and coarse!
Louisa and I were agreeingthat we should not have known her again.
"""However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contentedhimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration thanher being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in thesummer."
"""For my own part,"" she rejoined, ""I must confess that I never couldsee any beauty in her."
Her face is too thin; her complexion has nobrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.
Her nosewants character--there is nothing marked in its lines.
"Her teeth aretolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anythingextraordinary in them."
"They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I donot like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiencywithout fashion, which is intolerable."
"""Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was notthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not alwayswise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all thesuccess she expected."
"He was resolutely silent, however, and, from adetermination of making him speak, she continued:""I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we allwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollectyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.'"
"But afterwards sheseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty atone time."
"""""Yes,"" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, ""but _that_was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I haveconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."
"""He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction ofhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.Mrs."
"Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during theirvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested themboth."
"The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention."
"They talkedof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything buthimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought ofhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece'sbeginning the subject.Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter fromJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had beenrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; buton the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by thereceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked thatit had been missent elsewhere."
"Elizabeth was not surprised at it, asJane had written the direction remarkably ill.They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; andher uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off bythemselves."
The one missent must first be attended to; it had beenwritten five days ago.
"The beginning contained an account of all theirlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evidentagitation, gave more important intelligence."
"It was to this effect:""Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of amost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--beassured that we are all well."
"What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotlandwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!"
Imagine oursurprise.
"To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected."
"I amvery, very sorry."
So imprudent a match on both sides!
"But I am willingto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart."
"His choice isdisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.Our poor mother is sadly grieved."
My father bears it better.
Howthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said againsthim; we must forget it ourselves.
"They were off Saturday night abouttwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning ateight."
The express was sent off directly.
"My dear Lizzy, they must havepassed within ten miles of us."
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expecthim here soon.
"Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her oftheir intention."
"I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poormother."
"I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardlyknow what I have written."
"""Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowingwhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized theother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: ithad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first."
"""By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; Iwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, myhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent."
"DearestLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,and it cannot be delayed."
"Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickhamand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it hastaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not goneto Scotland."
"Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton theday before, not many hours after the express."
"Though Lydia's shortletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to GretnaGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which wasrepeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.intending to trace their route."
"He did trace them easily to Clapham,but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackneycoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom."
"All thatis known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.I know not what to think."
"After making every possible inquiry on thatside London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewingthem at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, butwithout any success--no such people had been seen to pass through."
"Withthe kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensionsto us in a manner most creditable to his heart."
"I am sincerely grievedfor him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them."
"Ourdistress, my dear Lizzy, is very great."
"My father and mother believe theworst, but I cannot think so ill of him."
"Many circumstances might makeit more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursuetheir first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against ayoung woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I supposeher so lost to everything?"
Impossible!
"I grieve to find, however, thatColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook hishead when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man tobe trusted."
"My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room."
"Could sheexert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected."
"Andas to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected."
"Poor Kitty hasanger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter ofconfidence, one cannot wonder."
"I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that youhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as thefirst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?"
"I am notso selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient."
Adieu!
Itake up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; butcircumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all tocome here as soon as possible.
"I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still somethingmore to ask of the former."
"My father is going to London with ColonelForster instantly, to try to discover her."
"What he means to do I am sureI know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue anymeasure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged tobe at Brighton again to-morrow evening."
"In such an exigence, myuncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he willimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""""Oh!"
"where, where is my uncle?"""
"cried Elizabeth, darting from her seatas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losinga moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it wasopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared."
"Her pale face and impetuousmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,hastily exclaimed, ""I beg your pardon, but I must leave you."
I must findMr.
"Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have notan instant to lose."
"""""Good God!"
"what is the matter?"""
"cried he, with more feeling thanpoliteness; then recollecting himself, ""I will not detain you a minute;but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner."
You arenot well enough; you cannot go yourself.
"""Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt howlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them."
"Calling backthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathlessan accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master andmistress home instantly.On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, andlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,""Let me call your maid."
Is there nothing you could take to give youpresent relief?
A glass of wine; shall I get you one?
"You are very ill.""""No, I thank you,"" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself."
"""Thereis nothing the matter with me."
I am quite well; I am only distressed bysome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.
"""She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes couldnot speak another word."
"Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only saysomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionatesilence."
At length she spoke again.
"""I have just had a letter from Jane,with such dreadful news."
It cannot be concealed from anyone.
My youngersister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself intothe power of--of Mr. Wickham.
They are gone off together from Brighton._You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.
"She has no money, noconnections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."
"""Darcy was fixed in astonishment."
"""When I consider,"" she added in a yetmore agitated voice, ""that I might have prevented it!"
"I, who knew whathe was."
"Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what Ilearnt, to my own family!"
"Had his character been known, this could nothave happened."
But it is all--all too late now.
"""""I am grieved indeed,"" cried Darcy; ""grieved--shocked."
But is itcertain--absolutely certain?
"""""Oh, yes!"
"They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were tracedalmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone toScotland."
"""""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"
"""""My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle'simmediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour."
Butnothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done.
How issuch a man to be worked on?
How are they even to be discovered?
I havenot the smallest hope.
It is every way horrible!
"""Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence."
"""When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh!"
"had I known whatI ought, what I dared to do!"
But I knew not--I was afraid of doing toomuch.
"Wretched, wretched mistake!"
"""Darcy made no answer."
"He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walkingup and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his airgloomy."
"Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it."
"Herpower was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of familyweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace."
"She could neitherwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothingconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress."
"Itwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her ownwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have lovedhim, as now, when all love must be vain.But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her."
"Lydia--thehumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowedup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause ofseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation bythe voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spokecompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, ""I am afraid you have beenlong desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of mystay, but real, though unavailing concern."
Would to Heaven that anythingcould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation tosuch distress!
"But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which mayseem purposely to ask for your thanks."
"This unfortunate affair will, Ifear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberleyto-day."
"""""Oh, yes."
Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.
Say thaturgent business calls us home immediately.
"Conceal the unhappy truth aslong as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."
"""He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow forher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at presentreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with onlyone serious, parting look, went away.As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that theyshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality ashad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw aretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so fullof contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of thosefeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and wouldformerly have rejoiced in its termination.If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth'schange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty."
"But ifotherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable orunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising ona first interview with its object, and even before two words have beenexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had givensomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the otherless interesting mode of attachment."
"Be that as it may, she saw himgo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy mustproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretchedbusiness."
"Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertaineda hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her."
"No one but Jane, she thought,could flatter herself with such an expectation."
Surprise was the leastof her feelings on this development.
"While the contents of the firstletter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment thatWickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marryfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appearedincomprehensible."
But now it was all too natural.
"For such an attachmentas this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not supposeLydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intentionof marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtuenor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, thatLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydiawanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody."
"Sometimes oneofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentionsraised them in her opinion."
Her affections had continually beenfluctuating but never without an object.
The mischief of neglect andmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh!
"how acutely did she nowfeel it!She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot toshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in afamily so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, andrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothingcould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmostimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe."
"Mr.and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant'saccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying theminstantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of theirsummons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscriptof the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been afavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeplyafflicted."
"Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after thefirst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised everyassistance in his power."
"Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thankedhim with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,everything relating to their journey was speedily settled."
They were tobe off as soon as possible.
"""But what is to be done about Pemberley?"
"""cried Mrs. Gardiner."
"""John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent forus; was it so?"
"""""Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement._That_ is all settled."
"""""What is all settled?"""
"repeated the other, as she ran into her room toprepare."
"""And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the realtruth?"
"Oh, that I knew how it was!"
"""But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in thehurry and confusion of the following hour."
"Had Elizabeth been at leisureto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment wasimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share ofbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes tobe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for theirsudden departure."
"An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothingremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery ofthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she couldhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn."
"""I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"" said her uncle, as theydrove from the town; ""and really, upon serious consideration, I am muchmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on thematter."
"It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man shouldform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected orfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that Iam strongly inclined to hope the best."
Could he expect that her friendswould not step forward?
"Could he expect to be noticed again by theregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?"
His temptation isnot adequate to the risk!
"""""Do you really think so?"""
"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment."
"""Upon my word,"" said Mrs. Gardiner, ""I begin to be of your uncle'sopinion."
"It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, andinterest, for him to be guilty of."
I cannot think so very ill ofWickham.
"Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believehim capable of it?"
"""""Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every otherneglect I can believe him capable."
"If, indeed, it should be so!"
But Idare not hope it.
Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had beenthe case?
"""""In the first place,"" replied Mr. Gardiner, ""there is no absolute proofthat they are not gone to Scotland.""""Oh!"
but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is sucha presumption!
"And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on theBarnet road."
"""""Well, then--supposing them to be in London."
"They may be there, thoughfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose."
"It isnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and itmight strike them that they could be more economically, though lessexpeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."
"""""But why all this secrecy?"
Why any fear of detection?
Why must theirmarriage be private?
"Oh, no, no--this is not likely."
"His most particularfriend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intendingto marry her."
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.
Hecannot afford it.
"And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has shebeyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?"
"As to whatrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on adishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I knownothing of the effects that such a step might produce."
"But as to yourother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good."
"Lydia hasno brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father'sbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has everseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ woulddo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, insuch a matter."
"""""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of himas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?"
"""""It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, withtears in her eyes, ""that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in sucha point should admit of doubt."
"But, really, I know not what to say.Perhaps I am not doing her justice."
"But she is very young; she has neverbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusementand vanity."
"She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idleand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,flirtation, and officers have been in her head."
"She has been doingeverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to givegreater--what shall I call it?"
susceptibility to her feelings; which arenaturally lively enough.
And we all know that Wickham has every charm ofperson and address that can captivate a woman.
"""""But you see that Jane,"" said her aunt, ""does not think so very ill ofWickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."
"""""Of whom does Jane ever think ill?"
"And who is there, whatever might betheir former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,till it were proved against them?"
"But Jane knows, as well as I do, whatWickham really is."
We both know that he has been profligate in everysense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he isas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.
"""""And do you really know all this?"""
"cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosityas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive."
"""I do indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, colouring."
"""I told you, the other day,of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last atLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behavedwith such forbearance and liberality towards him."
And there are othercircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while torelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.
"Fromwhat he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,reserved, disagreeable girl."
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.
Hemust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have foundher.
"""""But does Lydia know nothing of this?"
can she be ignorant of what youand Jane seem so well to understand?
"""""Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all."
"Till I was in Kent, and sawso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I wasignorant of the truth myself."
"And when I returned home, the ----shirewas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time."
"As that was thecase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought itnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use couldit apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all theneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown?"
"And even when it wassettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of openingher eyes to his character never occurred to me."
That _she_ could bein any danger from the deception never entered my head.
"That such aconsequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was farenough from my thoughts."
"""""When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, Isuppose, to believe them fond of each other?"
"""""Not the slightest."
"I can remember no symptom of affection on eitherside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be awarethat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away."
"When firsthe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we allwere."
"Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him forthe first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particularattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant andwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."""
"* * * * *It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be addedto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, byits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, duringthe whole of the journey."
"From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could findno interval of ease or forgetfulness.They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one nighton the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day."
"It was acomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been weariedby long expectations.The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standingon the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when thecarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up theirfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety ofcapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from hermother's apartment, immediately met her.Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled theeyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had beenheard of the fugitives."
"""Not yet,"" replied Jane."
"""But now that my dear uncle is come, I hopeeverything will be well."
"""""Is my father in town?"
"""""Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."
"""""And have you heard from him often?"
"""""We have heard only twice."
"He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to saythat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which Iparticularly begged him to do."
He merely added that he should not writeagain till he had something of importance to mention.
"""""And my mother--how is she?"
How are you all?
"""""My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatlyshaken."
She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing youall.
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.
"Mary and Kitty, thankHeaven, are quite well."
"""""But you--how are you?"""
cried Elizabeth.
"""You look pale."
How much youmust have gone through!
"""Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and theirconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner wereengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approachof the whole party."
"Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed andthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabethhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soonfound that Jane had no intelligence to give."
"The sanguine hope ofgood, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yetdeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and thatevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.Mrs."
"Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; withtears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainousconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence theerrors of her daughter must principally be owing."
"""If I had been able,"" said she, ""to carry my point in going to Brighton,with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydiahad nobody to take care of her."
Why did the Forsters ever let her go outof their sight?
"I am sure there was some great neglect or other on theirside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had beenwell looked after."
"I always thought they were very unfit to have thecharge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am."
"Poor dear child!And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to becomeof us all?"
"The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in hisgrave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what weshall do."
"""They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, aftergeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told herthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia."
"""Do not give way to useless alarm,"" added he; ""though it is right to beprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.It is not quite a week since they left Brighton."
"In a few days more wemay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over aslost."
"As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and makehim come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consulttogether as to what is to be done.""""Oh!"
"my dear brother,"" replied Mrs. Bennet, ""that is exactly what Icould most wish for."
"And now do, when you get to town, find them out,wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ themmarry."
"And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, buttell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,after they are married."
"And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of mywits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--suchspasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, thatI can get no rest by night nor by day."
"And tell my dear Lydia not togive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she doesnot know which are the best warehouses."
"Oh, brother, how kind you are!"
Iknow you will contrive it all.
"""But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavoursin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as wellin her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner tilldinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings onthe housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no realoccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt tooppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold hertongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged itbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they couldmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on thesubject.In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had beentoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearancebefore."
"One came from her books, and the other from her toilette."
"Thefaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visiblein either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the angerwhich she had herself incurred in this business, had given more offretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty."
"As for Mary, she wasmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenanceof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:""This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms ofeach other the balm of sisterly consolation."
"""Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,""Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this usefullesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that onefalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no lessbrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded inher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."
"""Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressedto make any reply."
"Mary, however, continued to console herself with suchkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be forhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself ofthe opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager tosatisfy."
"After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequelof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and MissBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continuedthe subject, by saying, ""But tell me all and everything about it whichI have not already heard."
Give me further particulars.
What did ColonelForster say?
Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopementtook place?
They must have seen them together for ever.
"""""Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm."
I am sogrieved for him!
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.
"He_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he hadany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehensionfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey."
"""""And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?"
Did he know oftheir intending to go off?
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?
"""""Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything oftheir plans, and would not give his real opinion about it."
"He did notrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I aminclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."
"""""And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained adoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"
"""""How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?"
"I felta little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with himin marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quiteright."
My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt howimprudent a match it must be.
"Kitty then owned, with a very naturaltriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last lettershe had prepared her for such a step."
"She had known, it seems, of theirbeing in love with each other, many weeks."
"""""But not before they went to Brighton?"
"""""No, I believe not."
"""""And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?"
Doeshe know his real character?
"""""I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerlydid."
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.
"And since this sadaffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;but I hope this may be false."
"""""Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,this could not have happened!"
"""""Perhaps it would have been better,"" replied her sister."
"""But to exposethe former faults of any person without knowing what their presentfeelings were, seemed unjustifiable."
We acted with the best intentions.
"""""Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to hiswife?"
"""""He brought it with him for us to see."
"""Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth."
"Thesewere the contents:""MY DEAR HARRIET,""You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot helplaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I ammissed."
"I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world Ilove, and he is an angel."
"I should never be happy without him, so thinkit no harm to be off."
"You need not send them word at Longbourn of mygoing, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.'"
What a good jokeit will be!
I can hardly write for laughing.
"Pray make my excuses toPratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I willdance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure."
I shallsend for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tellSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they arepacked up.
Good-bye.
Give my love to Colonel Forster.
I hope you willdrink to our good journey.
"""Your affectionate friend,""LYDIA BENNET.""""Oh!"

"""What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of theirjourney."
"Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on herside a _scheme_ of infamy."

"""""I never saw anyone so shocked."
He could not speak a word for full tenminutes.

But the horror of what might possibly happenalmost took from me my faculties.
"""""Your attendance upon her has been too much for you."
You do not lookwell.
Oh that I had been with you!
you have had every care and anxietyupon yourself alone.
"""""Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in everyfatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hoursof repose should not be broken in on."
"My aunt Phillips came to Longbournon Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay tillThursday with me."
She was of great use and comfort to us all.
"AndLady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning tocondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', ifthey should be of use to us."
"""""She had better have stayed at home,"" cried Elizabeth; ""perhaps she_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot seetoo little of one's neighbours."
Assistance is impossible; condolenceinsufferable.
"Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."
"""She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father hadintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter."
"""He meant I believe,"" replied Jane, ""to go to Epsom, the place wherethey last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything couldbe made out from them."
His principal object must be to discover thenumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.
It had comewith a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of agentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another mightbe remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.
"If he could anyhowdiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, hedetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossibleto find out the stand and number of the coach."
"I do not know of anyother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in findingout even so much as this."
"""The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the nextmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent anddilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence tosend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain."
"Mr.Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constantinformation of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the onlysecurity for her husband's not being killed in a duel.Mrs."
"Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a fewdays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceableto her nieces."
"She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was agreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom."
"Their other aunt alsovisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design ofcheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came withoutreporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she foundthem.All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three monthsbefore, had been almost an angel of light."
"He was declared to be in debtto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured withthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted theappearance of his goodness."
"Elizabeth, though she did not credit abovehalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance ofher sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still lessof it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now comewhen, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirelydespaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news ofthem.Mr."
"Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received aletter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediatelyfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was nowdetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennetthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their firstcoming to London, before they procured lodgings."
"Mr. Gardiner himselfdid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother waseager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it."
He added that Mr.Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promisedto write again very soon.
"There was also a postscript to this effect:""I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, ifpossible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely toknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself."
"If there wereanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such aclue as that, it might be of essential consequence."
At present we havenothing to guide us.
"Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything inhis power to satisfy us on this head."
"But, on second thoughts, perhaps,Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than anyother person."
"""Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to herauthority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any informationof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved."
"She had neverheard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, bothof whom had been dead many years."
"It was possible, however, that some ofhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the applicationwas a something to look forward to.Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxiouspart of each was when the post was expected."
The arrival of letterswas the grand object of every morning's impatience.
"Through letters,whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and everysucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived fortheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Janehad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities hisletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise."
"It was asfollows:""MY DEAR SIR,""I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situationin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are nowsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter fromHertfordshire."
"Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myselfsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, inyour present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, becauseproceeding from a cause which no time can remove."
"No arguments shall bewanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or thatmay comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others themost afflicting to a parent's mind."
The death of your daughter wouldhave been a blessing in comparison of this.
"And it is the more tobe lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotteinforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter hasproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to thinkthat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not beguilty of such an enormity, at so early an age."
"Howsoever that may be,you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joinedby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, towhom I have related the affair."
"They agree with me in apprehending thatthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes ofall the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,will connect themselves with such a family?"
"And this consideration leadsme moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain eventof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involvedin all your sorrow and disgrace."
"Let me then advise you, dear sir, toconsole yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy childfrom your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of herown heinous offense."
"""I am, dear sir, etc., etc.""Mr."
"Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer fromColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom hekept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near oneliving."
"His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since hehad been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms ofparticular friendship with any of them."
"There was no one, therefore,who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him."
"And in thewretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive forsecrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, forit had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to avery considerable amount."
"Colonel Forster believed that more than athousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still moreformidable."
Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particularsfrom the Longbourn family.
Jane heard them with horror.
"""A gamester!"
"""she cried."
"""This is wholly unexpected."
"I had not an idea of it.""Mr."
"Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see theirfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday."
"Renderedspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yieldedto his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, andleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisablefor continuing their pursuit."
"When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she didnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, consideringwhat her anxiety for his life had been before."
"""What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?"""
she cried.
"""Sure hewill not leave London before he has found them."
"Who is to fight Wickham,and make him marry her, if he comes away?"
"""As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that sheand the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennetcame from it."
"The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of theirjourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.Mrs."
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and herDerbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world.
"Hisname had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; andthe kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of theirbeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing."
"Elizabeth hadreceived none since her return that could come from Pemberley.The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse forthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could befairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this timetolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly awarethat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread ofLydia's infamy somewhat better."
"It would have spared her, she thought,one sleepless night out of two.When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usualphilosophic composure."
"He said as little as he had ever been in thehabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken himaway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak ofit.It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, thatElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her brieflyexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, ""Saynothing of that."
Who should suffer but myself?
"It has been my own doing,and I ought to feel it."
"""""You must not be too severe upon yourself,"" replied Elizabeth."
"""You may well warn me against such an evil."
Human nature is so proneto fall into it!
"No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I havebeen to blame."
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.It will pass away soon enough.
"""""Do you suppose them to be in London?"
"""""Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"
"""""And Lydia used to want to go to London,"" added Kitty."
"""She is happy then,"" said her father drily; ""and her residence therewill probably be of some duration."
"""Then after a short silence he continued:""Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to melast May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."
"""They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother'stea."
"""This is a parade,"" he cried, ""which does one good; it gives such anelegance to misfortune!"
"Another day I will do the same; I will sit in mylibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble asI can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."
"""""I am not going to run away, papa,"" said Kitty fretfully."
"""If I shouldever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."
"""""_You_ go to Brighton."
I would not trust you so near it as Eastbournefor fifty pounds!
"No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, andyou will feel the effects of it."
"No officer is ever to enter intomy house again, nor even to pass through the village."
"Balls will beabsolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you havespent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."
"""Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry."
"""Well, well,"" said he, ""do not make yourself unhappy."
"If you are a goodgirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end ofthem."
"""Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walkingtogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeepercoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to theirmother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, ""I beg your pardon,madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got somegood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."
"""""What do you mean, Hill?"
We have heard nothing from town.
"""""Dear madam,"" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, ""don't you knowthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?"
"He has been herethis half-hour, and master has had a letter."
"""Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech."
"Theyran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to thelibrary; their father was in neither; and they were on the point ofseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by thebutler, who said:""If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards thelittle copse."
"""Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall oncemore, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberatelypursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running asElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,came up with him, and eagerly cried out:""Oh, papa, what news--what news?"
Have you heard from my uncle?
"""""Yes I have had a letter from him by express."
"""""Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?"
"""""What is there of good to be expected?"""
"said he, taking the letter fromhis pocket."
"""But perhaps you would like to read it."
"""Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand."
Jane now came up.
"""Read it aloud,"" said their father, ""for I hardly know myself what it isabout."
"""""Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2."
"""MY DEAR BROTHER,""At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction."
"Soon after youleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part ofLondon they were."
The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enoughto know they are discovered.
"I have seen them both--""""Then it is as I always hoped,"" cried Jane; ""they are married!"
"""Elizabeth read on:""I have seen them both."
"They are not married, nor can I find therewas any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform theengagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it willnot be long before they are."
"All that is required of you is, to assureto your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousandpounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself andmy sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,during your life, one hundred pounds per annum."
"These are conditionswhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,as far as I thought myself privileged, for you."
"I shall send this byexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer."
"Youwill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham'scircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say therewill be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, tosettle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune."
"If, as I concludewill be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughoutthe whole of this business, I will immediately give directions toHaggerston for preparing a proper settlement."
"There will not be thesmallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet atLongbourn, and depend on my diligence and care."
"Send back your answer asfast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly."
"We have judged itbest that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hopeyou will approve."
She comes to us to-day.
I shall write again as soon asanything more is determined on.
"Yours, etc.,""EDW."
GARDINER.
"""""Is it possible?"""
"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished."
"""Can it bepossible that he will marry her?"
"""""Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,"" said hersister."
"""My dear father, I congratulate you."
"""""And have you answered the letter?"""
cried Elizabeth.
"""No; but it must be done soon."
"""Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before hewrote.""Oh!"
"my dear father,"" she cried, ""come back and write immediately.Consider how important every moment is in such a case."
"""""Let me write for you,"" said Jane, ""if you dislike the troubleyourself."
"""""I dislike it very much,"" he replied; ""but it must be done."
"""And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house."
"""And may I ask--"" said Elizabeth; ""but the terms, I suppose, must becomplied with."
"""""Complied with!"
I am only ashamed of his asking so little.
"""""And they _must_ marry!"
Yet he is _such_ a man!
"""""Yes, yes, they must marry."
There is nothing else to be done.
"But thereare two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much moneyyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I everto pay him.""""Money!"
"My uncle!"""
"cried Jane, ""what do you mean, sir?"
"""""I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight atemptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I amgone."
"""""That is very true,"" said Elizabeth; ""though it had not occurred to mebefore."
"His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!"
Oh!it must be my uncle's doings!
"Generous, good man, I am afraid he hasdistressed himself."
A small sum could not do all this.
"""""No,"" said her father; ""Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthingless than ten thousand pounds."
"I should be sorry to think so ill of him,in the very beginning of our relationship."
"""""Ten thousand pounds!"
Heaven forbid!
"How is half such a sum to berepaid?""Mr."
"Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continuedsilent till they reached the house."
"Their father then went on to thelibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room."
"""And they are really to be married!"""
"cried Elizabeth, as soon as theywere by themselves."
"""How strange this is!"
And for _this_ we are to bethankful.
"That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice."
"Oh, Lydia!"
"""""I comfort myself with thinking,"" replied Jane, ""that he certainly wouldnot marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her."
"Though our kinduncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that tenthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced."
"He has childrenof his own, and may have more."
How could he spare half ten thousandpounds?
"""""If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"" saidElizabeth, ""and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shallexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham hasnot sixpence of his own."
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can neverbe requited.
"Their taking her home, and affording her their personalprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage asyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge."
By this time she isactually with them!
"If such goodness does not make her miserable now,she will never deserve to be happy!"
"What a meeting for her, when shefirst sees my aunt!"
"""""We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"" saidJane: ""I hope and trust they will yet be happy."
"His consenting tomarry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way ofthinking."
"Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myselfthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may intime make their past imprudence forgotten."
"""""Their conduct has been such,"" replied Elizabeth, ""as neither you, norI, nor anybody can ever forget."
It is useless to talk of it.
"""It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihoodperfectly ignorant of what had happened."
"They went to the library,therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to makeit known to her."
"He was writing and, without raising his head, coollyreplied:""Just as you please."
"""""May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"
"""""Take whatever you like, and get away."
"""Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairstogether."
"Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communicationwould, therefore, do for all."
"After a slight preparation for good news,the letter was read aloud."
Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself.
"Assoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soonmarried, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to itsexuberance."
"She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as shehad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation."
To know that her daughterwould be married was enough.
"She was disturbed by no fear for herfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct."
"""My dear, dear Lydia!"""
she cried.
"""This is delightful indeed!"
She willbe married!
I shall see her again!
"She will be married at sixteen!My good, kind brother!"
I knew how it would be.
I knew he would manageeverything!
How I long to see her!
and to see dear Wickham too!
"But theclothes, the wedding clothes!"
I will write to my sister Gardiner aboutthem directly.
"Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask himhow much he will give her."
"Stay, stay, I will go myself."
"Ring the bell,Kitty, for Hill."
I will put on my things in a moment.
"My dear, dearLydia!"
How merry we shall be together when we meet!
"""Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence ofthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under."
"""For we must attribute this happy conclusion,"" she added, ""in a greatmeasure to his kindness."
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself toassist Mr. Wickham with money.
"""""Well,"" cried her mother, ""it is all very right; who should do it buther own uncle?"
"If he had not had a family of his own, I and my childrenmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we haveever had anything from him, except a few presents."
Well!
I am so happy!In a short time I shall have a daughter married.
Mrs. Wickham!
How wellit sounds!
And she was only sixteen last June.
"My dear Jane, I am insuch a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, andyou write for me."
We will settle with your father about the moneyafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.
"""She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, andcambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, hadnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till herfather was at leisure to be consulted."
"One day's delay, she observed,would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quiteso obstinate as usual."
"Other schemes, too, came into her head."
"""I will go to Meryton,"" said she, ""as soon as I am dressed, and tell thegood, good news to my sister Philips."
"And as I come back, I can callon Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long."
"Kitty, run down and order the carriage.An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure."
"Girls, can I doanything for you in Meryton?"
Oh!
Here comes Hill!
"My dear Hill, have youheard the good news?"
"Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shallall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.""Mrs."
Hill began instantly to express her joy.
"Elizabeth received hercongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, tookrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it wasno worse, she had need to be thankful."
"She felt it so; and though, inlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity couldbe justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they hadfeared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they hadgained.Mr."
"Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum forthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survivedhim."
He now wished it more than ever.
"Had he done his duty in thatrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whateverof honour or credit could now be purchased for her."
"The satisfaction ofprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to beher husband might then have rested in its proper place.He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyoneshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and hewas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectlyuseless, for, of course, they were to have a son."
"The son was to joinin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widowand younger children would by that means be provided for."
"Five daughterssuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that hewould."
"This event had at last been despaired of, but it was thentoo late to be saving."
"Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and herhusband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding theirincome.Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet andthe children."
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst thelatter depended on the will of the parents.
"This was one point, withregard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennetcould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him."
"Interms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfectapprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil theengagements that had been made for him."
"He had never before supposedthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it wouldbe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the presentarrangement."
"He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by thehundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocketallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to herthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little withinthat sum.That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, wasanother very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have aslittle trouble in the business as possible."
"When the first transportsof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, henaturally returned to all his former indolence."
"His letter was soondispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quickin its execution."
"He begged to know further particulars of what hewas indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send anymessage to her.The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionatespeed through the neighbourhood."
It was borne in the latter with decentphilosophy.
"To be sure, it would have been more for the advantageof conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as thehappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distantfarmhouse."
"But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and thegood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before fromall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spiritin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her miserywas considered certain.It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on thishappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and inspirits oppressively high."
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to hertriumph.
"The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first objectof her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point ofaccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on thoseattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, andservants."
"She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for aproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or consideringwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size andimportance."
"""Haye Park might do,"" said she, ""if the Gouldings could quit it--or thegreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth istoo far off!"
"I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as forPulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."
"""Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while theservants remained."
"But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: ""Mrs.Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son anddaughter, let us come to a right understanding."
Into _one_ house in thisneighbourhood they shall never have admittance.
"I will not encourage theimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."
"""A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm."
"Itsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for hisdaughter."
He protested that she should receive from him no mark ofaffection whatever on the occasion.
Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehendit.
"That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivableresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which hermarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believepossible."
"She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of newclothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense ofshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before theytook place.Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress ofthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears forher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give theproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal itsunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on thespot.She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means."
"There werefew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister'sfrailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fearof disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,there seemed a gulf impassable between them."
"Had Lydia's marriage beenconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed thatMr."
"Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every otherobjection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of thenearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink."
"Thewish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of hisfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such ablow as this."
"She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though shehardly knew of what."
"She became jealous of his esteem, when she could nolonger hope to be benefited by it."
"She wanted to hear of him, when thereseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence."
"She was convinced thatshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely theyshould meet.What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that theproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would nowhave been most gladly and gratefully received!"
"He was as generous, shedoubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,there must be a triumph.She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, indisposition and talents, would most suit her."
"His understanding andtemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes."
"Itwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her easeand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, shemust have received benefit of greater importance.But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude whatconnubial felicity really was."
"An union of a different tendency, andprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in theirfamily.How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,she could not imagine."
"But how little of permanent happiness couldbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passionswere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture."
* * * * *Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.
"To Mr. Bennet'sacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness topromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreatiesthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again."
The principalpurport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolvedon quitting the militia.
"""It was greatly my wish that he should do so,"" he added, ""as soon ashis marriage was fixed on."
"And I think you will agree with me, inconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both onhis account and my niece's."
"It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go intothe regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some whoare able and willing to assist him in the army."
"He has the promise of anensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North."
Itis an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.
"Hepromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may eachhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent."
"I havewritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickhamin and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which Ihave pledged myself."
"And will you give yourself the trouble of carryingsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoina list according to his information?"
He has given in all his debts; Ihope at least he has not deceived us.
"Haggerston has our directions,and all will be completed in a week."
"They will then join his regiment,unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before sheleaves the South."
"She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered toyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.,""E."
"GARDINER.""Mr."
Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removalfrom the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.
But Mrs. Bennetwas not so well pleased with it.
"Lydia's being settled in the North,just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing inHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such apity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquaintedwith everybody, and had so many favourites."
"""She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,"" said she, ""it will be quite shockingto send her away!"
"And there are several of the young men, too, that shelikes very much."
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'sregiment.
"""His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of beingadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,received at first an absolute negative."
"But Jane and Elizabeth,who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings andconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive herand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he wasprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished."
And theirmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to showher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to theNorth.
"When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he senthis permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon asthe ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn."
"Elizabeth wassurprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, andhad she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him wouldhave been the last object of her wishes.Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for herprobably more than she felt for herself."
"The carriage was sent tomeet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time."
"Theirarrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had shebeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sistermust endure.They came."
The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receivethem.
"Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up tothe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,anxious, uneasy.Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, andshe ran into the room."
"Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, andwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with analacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quiteso cordial."
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcelyopened his lips.
"The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, wasenough to provoke him."
"Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennetwas shocked."
"Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,and fearless."
"She turned from sister to sister, demanding theircongratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerlyround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, andobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had beenthere.Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his mannerswere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage beenexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while heclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all."
"Elizabeth hadnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudenceof an impudent man."
"She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of thetwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.There was no want of discourse."
"The bride and her mother could neitherof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit nearElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in herreplies."
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in theworld.
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia ledvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to forthe world.
"""Only think of its being three months,"" she cried, ""since I went away;it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been thingsenough happened in the time."
Good gracious!
"when I went away, I am sureI had no more idea of being married till I came back again!"
though Ithought it would be very good fun if I was.
"""Her father lifted up his eyes."
Jane was distressed.
"Elizabeth lookedexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything ofwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, ""Oh!"
"mamma, do thepeople hereabouts know I am married to-day?"
"I was afraid they might not;and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined heshould know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and tookoff my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so thathe might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."
"""Elizabeth could bear it no longer."
"She got up, and ran out of the room;and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall tothe dining parlour."
"She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, withanxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her sayto her eldest sister, ""Ah!"
"Jane, I take your place now, and you must golower, because I am a married woman."
"""It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassmentfrom which she had been so wholly free at first."
Her ease and goodspirits increased.
"She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, andall their other neighbours, and to hear herself called ""Mrs. Wickham""by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show herring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids."
"""Well, mamma,"" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfastroom, ""and what do you think of my husband?"
Is not he a charming man?
Iam sure my sisters must all envy me.
I only hope they may have halfmy good luck.
They must all go to Brighton.
That is the place to gethusbands.
"What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."
"""""Very true; and if I had my will, we should."
"But my dear Lydia, I don'tat all like your going such a way off."
Must it be so?
"""""Oh, lord!"
yes;--there is nothing in that.
I shall like it of allthings.
"You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us."
"Weshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be someballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."
"""""I should like it beyond anything!"""
said her mother.
"""And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sistersbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before thewinter is over."
"""""I thank you for my share of the favour,"" said Elizabeth; ""but I do notparticularly like your way of getting husbands."
"""Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them."
"Mr. Wickhamhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to joinhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; andshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, andhaving very frequent parties at home."
"These parties were acceptable toall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as didthink, than such as did not.Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expectedto find it; not equal to Lydia's for him."
"She had scarcely needed herpresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, thattheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, ratherthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caringfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certainthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; andif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunityof having a companion.Lydia was exceedingly fond of him."
He was her dear Wickham on everyoccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.
"He did everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds onthe first of September, than any body else in the country.One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her twoelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:""Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe."
"Youwere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it."
Are not youcurious to hear how it was managed?
"""""No really,"" replied Elizabeth; ""I think there cannot be too little saidon the subject.""""La!"
You are so strange!
But I must tell you how it went off.
"We weremarried, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were inthat parish."
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleveno'clock.
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the otherswere to meet us at the church.
"Well, Monday morning came, and I was insuch a fuss!"
"I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen toput it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted."
"And there wasmy aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just asif she was reading a sermon."
"However, I did not hear above one word inten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham."
I longedto know whether he would be married in his blue coat.
"""""Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would neverbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and auntwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them."
"If you'll believeme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there afortnight."
"Not one party, or scheme, or anything."
"To be sure London wasrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open."
"Well, and sojust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away uponbusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone."
"And then, you know, when oncethey get together, there is no end of it."
"Well, I was so frightened Idid not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if wewere beyond the hour, we could not be married all day."
"But, luckily, hecame back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out."
"However,I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, thewedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""""Mr."
"Darcy!"""
"repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement."
"""Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know."
But graciousme!
I quite forgot!
I ought not to have said a word about it.
I promisedthem so faithfully!
What will Wickham say?
It was to be such a secret!
"""""If it was to be secret,"" said Jane, ""say not another word on thesubject."
"You may depend upon my seeking no further.""""Oh!"
"certainly,"" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; ""we willask you no questions."
"""""Thank you,"" said Lydia, ""for if you did, I should certainly tell youall, and then Wickham would be angry."
"""On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of herpower, by running away.But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at leastit was impossible not to try for information."
Mr. Darcy had been ather sister's wedding.
"It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into herbrain; but she was satisfied with none."
"Those that best pleased her, asplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable."
"Shecould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of whatLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had beenintended."
"""You may readily comprehend,"" she added, ""what my curiosity must beto know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparativelyspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at sucha time."
"Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seemsto think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied withignorance."
"""""Not that I _shall_, though,"" she added to herself, as she finishedthe letter; ""and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourablemanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find itout."
"""Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak toElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was gladof it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive anysatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter assoon as she possibly could."
"She was no sooner in possession of itthan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely tobe interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared tobe happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did notcontain a denial."
"""Gracechurch street, Sept."
6.
"""MY DEAR NIECE,""I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morningto answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprisewhat I have to tell you."
I must confess myself surprised by yourapplication; I did not expect it from _you_.
"Don't think me angry,however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined suchinquiries to be necessary on _your_ side."
"If you do not choose tounderstand me, forgive my impertinence."
Your uncle is as much surprisedas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concernedwould have allowed him to act as he has done.
"But if you are reallyinnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit."
"""On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a mostunexpected visitor."
"Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him severalhours."
It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not sodreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been.
"He came to tell Mr.Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,Lydia once."
"From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one dayafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting forthem."
The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing tohimself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as tomake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confidein him.
"He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, andconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his privateactions open to the world."
His character was to speak for itself.
"Hecalled it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedyan evil which had been brought on by himself."
"If he _had another_motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him."
"He had been some daysin town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something todirect his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousnessof this was another reason for his resolving to follow us."
"""There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time agogoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some causeof disapprobation, though he did not say what."
"She then took a largehouse in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by lettinglodgings."
"This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted withWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got totown."
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what hewanted.
"She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery andcorruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and hadshe been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken uptheir abode with her."
"At length, however, our kind friend procured thewished-for direction."
They were in ---- street.
"He saw Wickham, andafterwards insisted on seeing Lydia."
"His first object with her, heacknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgracefulsituation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailedon to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go."
Buthe found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.
She caredfor none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hearof leaving Wickham.
"She was sure they should be married some time orother, and it did not much signify when."
"Since such were her feelings,it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had neverbeen _his_ design."
"He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; andscrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on herown folly alone."
"He meant to resign his commission immediately; and asto his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it."
"Hemust go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should havenothing to live on.""Mr."
Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.
ThoughMr.
"Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been ableto do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited bymarriage."
"But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham stillcherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage insome other country."
"Under such circumstances, however, he was not likelyto be proof against the temptation of immediate relief."
"""They met several times, for there was much to be discussed."
Wickham ofcourse wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to bereasonable.
"""Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was tomake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurchstreet the evening before I came home."
"But Mr. Gardiner could not beseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father wasstill with him, but would quit town the next morning."
"He did not judgeyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as youruncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after thedeparture of the former."
"He did not leave his name, and till the nextday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business."
"""On Saturday he came again."
"Your father was gone, your uncle at home,and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together."
"""They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too."
"It was not allsettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off toLongbourn."
But our visitor was very obstinate.
"I fancy, Lizzy, thatobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all."
"He has beenaccused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (andI do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), youruncle would most readily have settled the whole."
"""They battled it together for a long time, which was more than eitherthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved."
"But at last your unclewas forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to hisniece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letterthis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanationthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise whereit was due."
"But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Janeat most."
"""You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the youngpeople."
"His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerablymore than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her ownsettled upon _her_, and his commission purchased."
"The reason why allthis was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above."
"Itwas owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, thatWickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that hehad been received and noticed as he was."
"Perhaps there was some truthin _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,can be answerable for the event."
"But in spite of all this fine talking,my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle wouldnever have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _anotherinterest_ in the affair."
"""When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, whowere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be inLondon once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters werethen to receive the last finish."
"""I believe I have now told you every thing."
It is a relation whichyou tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will notafford you any displeasure.
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constantadmission to the house.
"_He_ was exactly what he had been, when Iknew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I wassatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had notperceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on cominghome was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tellyou can give you no fresh pain."
"I talked to her repeatedly in the mostserious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she haddone, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family."
"If sheheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen."
"I wassometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth andJane, and for their sakes had patience with her.""Mr."
"Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,attended the wedding."
"He dined with us the next day, and was to leavetown again on Wednesday or Thursday."
"Will you be very angry with me, mydear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never boldenough to say before) how much I like him."
"His behaviour to us has,in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire."
"Hisunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a littlemore liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teachhim."
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name.
Butslyness seems the fashion.
"""Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do notpunish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happytill I have been all round the park."
"A low phaeton, with a nice littlepair of ponies, would be the very thing."
"""But I must write no more."
The children have been wanting me this halfhour.
"""Yours, very sincerely,""M."
GARDINER.
"""The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore thegreatest share."
"The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty hadproduced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister'smatch, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness toogreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from thepain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself allthe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in whichsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate anddespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reasonwith, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished toavoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce."
He haddone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.
Herheart did whisper that he had done it for her.
"But it was a hope shortlychecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanitywas insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--fora woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment sonatural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham."
Brother-in-lawof Wickham!
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.
"He had,to be sure, done much."
She was ashamed to think how much.
"But he hadgiven a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinarystretch of belief."
"It was reasonable that he should feel he had beenwrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; andthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, shecould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assisthis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materiallyconcerned."
"It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they wereunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return."
"Theyowed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him."
"Oh!how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had everencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him."
Forherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.
"Proud that in a causeof compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again."
Itwas hardly enough; but it pleased her.
"She was even sensible of somepleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both sheand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsistedbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one'sapproach; and before she could strike into another path, she wasovertaken by Wickham."
"""I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"""
"said he,as he joined her."
"""You certainly do,"" she replied with a smile; ""but it does not followthat the interruption must be unwelcome."
"""""I should be sorry indeed, if it were."
"We were always good friends; andnow we are better.""""True."
Are the others coming out?
"""""I do not know."
Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage toMeryton.
"And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, thatyou have actually seen Pemberley."
"""She replied in the affirmative."
"""I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too muchfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle."
"And you saw theold housekeeper, I suppose?"
"Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond ofme."
But of course she did not mention my name to you.
"""""Yes, she did."
"""""And what did she say?"
"""""That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turnedout well."
"At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangelymisrepresented."
"""""Certainly,"" he replied, biting his lips."
"Elizabeth hoped she hadsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said:""I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month."
We passed each otherseveral times.
I wonder what he can be doing there.
"""""Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"" saidElizabeth."
"""It must be something particular, to take him there at thistime of year.""""Undoubtedly."
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?
I thought Iunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.
"""""Yes; he introduced us to his sister."
"""""And do you like her?"
"""""Very much."
"""""I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this yearor two."
"When I last saw her, she was not very promising."
I am very gladyou liked her.
I hope she will turn out well.
"""""I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."
"""""Did you go by the village of Kympton?"
"""""I do not recollect that we did."
"""""I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had."
Amost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!
It would have suitedme in every respect.
"""""How should you have liked making sermons?"
"""""Exceedingly well."
"I should have considered it as part of my duty,and the exertion would soon have been nothing."
"One ought not torepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!"
"Thequiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideasof happiness!"
But it was not to be.
"Did you ever hear Darcy mention thecircumstance, when you were in Kent?"
"""""I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it wasleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."
"""""You have."
"Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from thefirst, you may remember."
"""""I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was notso palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actuallydeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the businesshad been compromised accordingly."
"""""You did!"
and it was not wholly without foundation.
"You may rememberwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."
"""They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fastto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:""Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know."
Do not letus quarrel about the past.
"In future, I hope we shall be always of onemind."
"""She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, thoughhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.Mr."
"Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that henever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that shehad said enough to keep him quiet.The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet wasforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no meansentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely tocontinue at least a twelvemonth.""Oh!"
"my dear Lydia,"" she cried, ""when shall we meet again?"
"""""Oh, lord!"
I don't know.
"Not these two or three years, perhaps."
"""""Write to me very often, my dear."
"""""As often as I can."
But you know married women have never much time forwriting.
My sisters may write to _me_.
"They will have nothing else todo.""Mr."
Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.
"Hesmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things."
"""He is as fine a fellow,"" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out ofthe house, ""as ever I saw."
"He simpers, and smirks, and makes love tous all."
I am prodigiously proud of him.
I defy even Sir William Lucashimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.
"""The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days."
"""I often think,"" said she, ""that there is nothing so bad as parting withone's friends."
One seems so forlorn without them.
"""""This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,"" saidElizabeth."
"""It must make you better satisfied that your other four aresingle."
"""""It is no such thing."
"Lydia does not leave me because she is married,but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off."
"Ifthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."
"""But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortlyrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by anarticle of news which then began to be in circulation."
"The housekeeperat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of hermaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for severalweeks."
Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.
"She looked at Jane, andsmiled and shook her head by turns."
"""Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"" (for Mrs.Phillips first brought her the news)."
"""Well, so much the better."
"Notthat I care about it, though."
"He is nothing to us, you know, and I amsure _I_ never want to see him again."
"But, however, he is very welcometo come to Netherfield, if he likes it."
And who knows what _may_ happen?But that is nothing to us.
"You know, sister, we agreed long ago never tomention a word about it."
"And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
"""""You may depend on it,"" replied the other, ""for Mrs. Nicholls was inMeryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purposeto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true."
"Hecomes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday."
"She wasgoing to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat onWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."
"""Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changingcolour."
"It was many months since she had mentioned his name toElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:""I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the presentreport; and I know I appeared distressed."
But don't imagine it was fromany silly cause.
"I was only confused for the moment, because I felt thatI _should_ be looked at."
I do assure you that the news does not affectme either with pleasure or pain.
"I am glad of one thing, that he comesalone; because we shall see the less of him."
"Not that I am afraid of_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."
"""Elizabeth did not know what to make of it."
"Had she not seen him inDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with noother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partialto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his comingthere _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to comewithout it."
"""Yet it is hard,"" she sometimes thought, ""that this poor man cannotcome to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all thisspeculation!"
I _will_ leave him to himself.
"""In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be herfeelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easilyperceive that her spirits were affected by it."
"They were more disturbed,more unequal, than she had often seen them.The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again."
"""As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""youwill wait on him of course."
"""""No, no."
"You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if Iwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters."
"But it ended innothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."
"""His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attentionwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning toNetherfield."
"""'Tis an etiquette I despise,"" said he."
"""If he wants our society,let him seek it."
He knows where we live.
I will not spend my hoursin running after my neighbours every time they go away and come backagain.
"""""Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not waiton him."
"But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, Iam determined."
We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.
"That willmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table forhim."
"""Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear herhusband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that herneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before_they_ did."
"As the day of his arrival drew near,--""I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,"" said Jane to her sister."
"""Itwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I canhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of."
"My mother means well;but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what shesays."
"Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"
"""""I wish I could say anything to comfort you,"" replied Elizabeth; ""but itis wholly out of my power."
"You must feel it; and the usual satisfactionof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you havealways so much.""Mr."
Bingley arrived.
"Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxietyand fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could."
She countedthe days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;hopeless of seeing him before.
"But on the third morning after hisarrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,enter the paddock and ride towards the house.Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy."
"Jane resolutelykept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, wentto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat downagain by her sister."
"""There is a gentleman with him, mamma,"" said Kitty; ""who can it be?"
"""""Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do notknow.""""La!"""
"replied Kitty, ""it looks just like that man that used to be withhim before."
Mr. what's-his-name.
"That tall, proud man."
"""""Good gracious!"
Mr.
"Darcy!--and so it does, I vow."
"Well, any friend ofMr."
"Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I mustsay that I hate the very sight of him."
"""Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern."
"She knew but littleof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardnesswhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first timeafter receiving his explanatory letter."
Both sisters were uncomfortableenough.
"Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and theirmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to becivil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by eitherof them."
"But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not besuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensiveinformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebtedfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with aninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just aswhat Jane felt for Bingley."
"Her astonishment at his coming--at hiscoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his alteredbehaviour in Derbyshire.The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half aminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre toher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection andwishes must still be unshaken."
But she would not be secure.
"""Let me first see how he behaves,"" said she; ""it will then be earlyenough for expectation."
"""She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring tolift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face ofher sister as the servant was approaching the door."
"Jane looked a littlepaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected."
"On thegentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them withtolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from anysymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat downagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command."
Shehad ventured only one glance at Darcy.
"He looked serious, as usual; and,she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than asshe had seen him at Pemberley."
"But, perhaps he could not in her mother'spresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt."
"It was a painful, butnot an improbable, conjecture.Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short periodsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed."
"He was received by Mrs.Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness ofher curtsey and address to his friend.Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latterthe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so illapplied.Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a questionwhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything."
Hewas not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; butit had not been so in Derbyshire.
"There he had talked to her friends,when he could not to herself."
"But now several minutes elapsed withoutbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resistthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as oftenfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object butthe ground."
"More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than whenthey last met, were plainly expressed."
"She was disappointed, and angrywith herself for being so."
"""Could I expect it to be otherwise!"""
said she.
"""Yet why did he come?"
"""She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and tohim she had hardly courage to speak.She inquired after his sister, but could do no more."
"""It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"" said Mrs. Bennet.He readily agreed to it."
"""I began to be afraid you would never come back again."
"People _did_ sayyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hopeit is not true."
"A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,since you went away."
Miss Lucas is married and settled.
And one of myown daughters.
"I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must haveseen it in the papers."
"It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;though it was not put in as it ought to be."
"It was only said, 'Lately,George Wickham, Esq."
"to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being asyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came tomake such an awkward business of it."
Did you see it?
"""Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations."
Elizabethdared not lift up her eyes.
"How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she couldnot tell."
"""It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,""continued her mother, ""but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is veryhard to have her taken such a way from me."
"They are gone down toNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stayI do not know how long."
"His regiment is there; for I suppose you haveheard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into theregulars."
Thank Heaven!
"he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not somany as he deserves."
"""Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in suchmisery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat."
"It drew from her,however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectuallydone before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay inthe country at present."
"A few weeks, he believed."
"""When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"" said her mother,""I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.Bennet's manor."
"I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, andwill save all the best of the covies for you."
"""Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officiousattention!"
"Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as hadflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would behastening to the same vexatious conclusion."
"At that instant, she feltthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends formoments of such painful confusion."
"""The first wish of my heart,"" said she to herself, ""is never more tobe in company with either of them."
Their society can afford no pleasurethat will atone for such wretchedness as this!
Let me never see eitherone or the other again!
"""Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer nocompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observinghow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of herformer lover."
"When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention."
"Hefound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, andas unaffected, though not quite so chatty."
"Jane was anxious that nodifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuadedthat she talked as much as ever."
"But her mind was so busily engaged,that she did not always know when she was silent.When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of herintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine atLongbourn in a few days time."
"""You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,"" she added, ""for whenyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner withus, as soon as you returned."
"I have not forgot, you see; and I assureyou, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keepyour engagement."
"""Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something ofhis concern at having been prevented by business."
They then went away.Mrs.
"Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dinethere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she didnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a manon whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and prideof one who had ten thousand a year.As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects thatmust deaden them more."
Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.
"""Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"" said she,""did he come at all?"
"""She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure."
"""He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, whenhe was in town; and why not to me?"
"If he fears me, why come hither?"
"Ifhe no longer cares for me, why silent?"
"Teasing, teasing, man!"
I willthink no more about him.
"""Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approachof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed herbetter satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth."
"""Now,"" said she, ""that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectlyeasy."
"I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again byhis coming."
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.
"It will then be publiclyseen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferentacquaintance."
"""""Yes, very indifferent indeed,"" said Elizabeth, laughingly."
"""Oh, Jane,take care."
"""""My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"
"""""I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love withyou as ever."""
"* * * * *They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, inthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the goodhumour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, hadrevived.On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the twowho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctualityas sportsmen, were in very good time."
"When they repaired to thedining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would takethe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, byher sister."
"Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forboreto invite him to sit by herself."
"On entering the room, he seemed tohesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it wasdecided."
"He placed himself by her.Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined thatBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyeslikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughingalarm.His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed anadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuadedElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and hisown, would be speedily secured."
"Though she dared not depend upon theconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour."
Itgave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was inno cheerful humour.
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the tablecould divide them.
He was on one side of her mother.
"She knew how littlesuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear toadvantage."
"She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, butshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal andcold was their manner whenever they did."
"Her mother's ungraciousness,made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tellhim that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of thefamily.She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity ofbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass awaywithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation thanthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance."
"Anxiousand uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before thegentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made heruncivil."
She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which allher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
"""If he does not come to me, _then_,"" said she, ""I shall give him up forever."
"""The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would haveanswered her hopes; but, alas!"
"the ladies had crowded round the table,where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near herwhich would admit of a chair."
"And on the gentlemen's approaching, one ofthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:""The men shan't come and part us, I am determined."
We want none of them;do we?
"""Darcy had walked away to another part of the room."
"She followed him withher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enoughto help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself forbeing so silly!"
"""A man who has once been refused!"
How could I ever be foolish enough toexpect a renewal of his love?
"Is there one among the sex, who would notprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"
"""She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cuphimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:""Is your sister at Pemberley still?"
"""""Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
"""""And quite alone?"
"Have all her friends left her?""""Mrs."
Annesley is with her.
"The others have been gone on to Scarborough,these three weeks."
"""She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to conversewith her, he might have better success."
"He stood by her, however, forsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whisperingto Elizabeth again, he walked away.When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladiesall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to hermother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seatedwith the rest of the party."
"She now lost every expectation of pleasure.They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she hadnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her sideof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.Mrs."
"Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen tosupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of theothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them."
"""Well girls,"" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, ""Whatsay you to the day?"
"I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,I assure you."
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.
Thevenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw sofat a haunch.
"The soup was fifty times better than what we had at theLucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridgeswere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three Frenchcooks at least."
"And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greaterbeauty."
"Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not."
Andwhat do you think she said besides?
'Ah!
"Mrs. Bennet, we shall have herat Netherfield at last.'"
She did indeed.
"I do think Mrs. Long is as gooda creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.""Mrs."
"Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough ofBingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him atlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happyhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed atnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals."
"""It has been a very agreeable day,"" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth."
"""Theparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other."
I hope wemay often meet again.
"""Elizabeth smiled."
"""Lizzy, you must not do so."
You must not suspect me.
"It mortifies me.I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as anagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it."
"I amperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never hadany design of engaging my affection."
"It is only that he is blessedwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generallypleasing, than any other man."
"""""You are very cruel,"" said her sister, ""you will not let me smile, andare provoking me to it every moment."
"""""How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
"""""And how impossible in others!"
"""""But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than Iacknowledge?"
"""""That is a question which I hardly know how to answer."
"We all love toinstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing."
"Forgiveme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."
"""A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone."
"Hisfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home inten days time."
"He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkablygood spirits."
"Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with manyexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere."
"""Next time you call,"" said she, ""I hope we shall be more lucky."
"""He should be particularly happy at any time, etc."
etc.
"; and if she wouldgive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them."
"""Can you come to-morrow?"
"""Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation wasaccepted with alacrity.He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of themdressed."
"In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressinggown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:""My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down."
He is come--Mr. Bingley iscome.
"He is, indeed."
"Make haste, make haste."
"Here, Sarah, come to MissBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown."
Never mind MissLizzy's hair.
"""""We will be down as soon as we can,"" said Jane; ""but I dare say Kitty isforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.""""Oh!"
hang Kitty!
what has she to do with it?
"Come be quick, be quick!Where is your sash, my dear?"
"""But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go downwithout one of her sisters.The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in theevening."
"After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was hiscustom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument."
"Two obstacles ofthe five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking atElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making anyimpression on them."
"Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at lastKitty did, she very innocently said, ""What is the matter mamma?"
What doyou keep winking at me for?
What am I to do?
"""""Nothing child, nothing."
"I did not wink at you."""
"She then sat stillfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, shesuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, ""Come here, my love, I want tospeak to you,"" took her out of the room."
"Jane instantly gave a lookat Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and herentreaty that _she_ would not give in to it."
"In a few minutes, Mrs.Bennet half-opened the door and called out:""Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
"""Elizabeth was forced to go."
"""We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"" said her mother, assoon as she was in the hall."
"""Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit inmy dressing-room."
"""Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remainedquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returnedinto the drawing-room.Mrs."
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.
"Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter."
"Hisease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to theirevening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of themother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and commandof countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he wentaway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference."
"Not a word passedbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed inthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcyreturned within the stated time."
"Seriously, however, she felt tolerablypersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman'sconcurrence.Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spentthe morning together, as had been agreed on."
The latter was much moreagreeable than his companion expected.
"There was nothing of presumptionor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him intosilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than theother had ever seen him."
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to getevery body away from him and her daughter.
"Elizabeth, who had a letterto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not bewanted to counteract her mother's schemes.But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, shesaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her motherhad been too ingenious for her."
"On opening the door, she perceived hersister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged inearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces ofboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, wouldhave told it all."
Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ shethought was still worse.
"Not a syllable was uttered by either; andElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who aswell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a fewwords to her sister, ran out of the room.Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would givepleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliestemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world."
"""'Tis too much!"""
"she added, ""by far too much."
I do not deserve it.
Oh!why is not everybody as happy?
"""Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,a delight, which words could but poorly express."
Every sentence ofkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.
"But she would notallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to besaid for the present."
"""I must go instantly to my mother;"" she cried."
"""I would not on anyaccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear itfrom anyone but myself."
He is gone to my father already.
Oh!
"Lizzy, toknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dearfamily!"
how shall I bear so much happiness!
"""She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up thecard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and easewith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so manyprevious months of suspense and vexation."
"""And this,"" said she, ""is the end of all his friend's anxiouscircumspection!"
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!
"thehappiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"
"""In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with herfather had been short and to the purpose."
"""Where is your sister?"""
"said he hastily, as he opened the door."
"""With my mother up stairs."
"She will be down in a moment, I dare say."
"""He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishesand affection of a sister."
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressedher delight in the prospect of their relationship.
"They shook hands withgreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listento all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all hisexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had forbasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition ofJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her andhimself.It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction ofMiss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, asmade her look handsomer than ever."
"Kitty simpered and smiled, and hopedher turn was coming soon."
"Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent orspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and whenMr."
"Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showedhow really happy he was.Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till theirvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, heturned to his daughter, and said:""Jane, I congratulate you."
You will be a very happy woman.
"""Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for hisgoodness."
"""You are a good girl;"" he replied, ""and I have great pleasure inthinking you will be so happily settled."
I have not a doubt of yourdoing very well together.
Your tempers are by no means unlike.
"You areeach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; soeasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you willalways exceed your income."
"""""I hope not so."
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would beunpardonable in me.
"""""Exceed their income!"
"My dear Mr. Bennet,"" cried his wife, ""what are youtalking of?"
"Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likelymore."""
"Then addressing her daughter, ""Oh!"
"my dear, dear Jane, I am sohappy!"
I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night.
I knew how itwould be.
"I always said it must be so, at last."
I was sure you could notbe so beautiful for nothing!
"I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, whenhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it wasthat you should come together."
Oh!
he is the handsomest young man thatever was seen!
"""Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten."
Jane was beyond competition herfavourite child.
"At that moment, she cared for no other."
"Her youngersisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happinesswhich she might in future be able to dispense.Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kittybegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till aftersupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enoughdetested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himselfobliged to accept.Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; forwhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hoursof separation that must sometimes occur."
"In the absence of Jane, healways attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking ofher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means ofrelief."
"""He has made me so happy,"" said she, one evening, ""by telling me that hewas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!"
I had not believedit possible.
"""""I suspected as much,"" replied Elizabeth."
"""But how did he account forit?"
"""""It must have been his sister's doing."
"They were certainly no friends tohis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might havechosen so much more advantageously in many respects."
"But when they see,as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they willlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though wecan never be what we once were to each other."
"""""That is the most unforgiving speech,"" said Elizabeth, ""that I everheard you utter."
Good girl!
"It would vex me, indeed, to see you againthe dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."
"""""Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ beingindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"
"""""He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of hismodesty."
"""This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, andthe little value he put on his own good qualities."
"Elizabeth was pleasedto find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, sheknew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him."
"""I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"""
criedJane.
"""Oh!"
"Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessedabove them all!"
If I could but see _you_ as happy!
If there _were_ butsuch another man for you!
"""""If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy asyou."
"Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have yourhappiness."
"No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have verygood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."
"""The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long asecret."
"Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all herneighbours in Meryton.The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in theworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had beenformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in thedining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by thesound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving upthe lawn."
"It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, theequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours."
"The horseswere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant whopreceded it, were familiar to them."
"As it was certain, however, thatsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoidthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into theshrubbery."
"They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining threecontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrownopen and their visitor entered."
"It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.They were of course all intending to be surprised; but theirastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, eveninferior to what Elizabeth felt.She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made noother reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of thehead, and sat down without saying a word."
"Elizabeth had mentioned hername to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request ofintroduction had been made.Mrs."
"Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of suchhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness."
"After sittingfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,""I hope you are well, Miss Bennet."
"That lady, I suppose, is yourmother."
"""Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was."
"""And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."
"""""Yes, madam,"" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine."
"""She is my youngest girl but one."
"My youngest of all is lately married,and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young manwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."
"""""You have a very small park here,"" returned Lady Catherine after a shortsilence."
"""It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but Iassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."
"""""This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, insummer; the windows are full west.""Mrs."
"Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and thenadded:""May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. andMrs."
Collins well.
"""""Yes, very well."
I saw them the night before last.
"""Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her fromCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling."
"But noletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.Mrs."
"Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take somerefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,""Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wildernesson one side of your lawn."
"I should be glad to take a turn in it, if youwill favour me with your company."
"""""Go, my dear,"" cried her mother, ""and show her ladyship about thedifferent walks."
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.
"""Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,attended her noble guest downstairs."
"As they passed through thehall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour anddrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decentlooking rooms, walked on.Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that herwaiting-woman was in it."
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walkthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort forconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent anddisagreeable.
"""How could I ever think her like her nephew?"""
"said she, as she looked inher face.As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the followingmanner:--""You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of myjourney hither."
"Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why Icome."
"""Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment."
"""Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam."
I have not been at all able to accountfor the honour of seeing you here.
"""""Miss Bennet,"" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, ""you ought toknow, that I am not to be trifled with."
"But however insincere _you_ maychoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so."
"My character has ever beencelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of suchmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it."
A report of a mostalarming nature reached me two days ago.
"I was told that not only yoursister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but thatyou, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soonafterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy."
"Though I_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure himso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolvedon setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known toyou."
"""""If you believed it impossible to be true,"" said Elizabeth, colouringwith astonishment and disdain, ""I wonder you took the trouble of comingso far."
What could your ladyship propose by it?
"""""At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."
"""""Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,"" said Elizabethcoolly, ""will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a reportis in existence.""""If!"
Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?
Has it not beenindustriously circulated by yourselves?
Do you not know that such areport is spread abroad?
"""""I never heard that it was."
"""""And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"
"""""I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship."
You mayask questions which I shall not choose to answer.
"""""This is not to be borne."
"Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied."
"Hashe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"
"""""Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."
"""""It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of hisreason."
"But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family."
Youmay have drawn him in.
"""""If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."
"""""Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?"
I have not been accustomed to suchlanguage as this.
"I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."
"""""But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,ever induce me to be explicit."
"""""Let me be rightly understood."
"This match, to which you have thepresumption to aspire, can never take place."
"No, never."
Mr. Darcy isengaged to my daughter.
Now what have you to say?
"""""Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he willmake an offer to me."
"""Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:""The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind."
"From their infancy,they have been intended for each other."
"It was the favourite wish of_his_ mother, as well as of hers."
"While in their cradles, we plannedthe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters wouldbe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman ofinferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied tothe family!"
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?
To histacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?
Are you lost to every feeling ofpropriety and delicacy?
Have you not heard me say that from his earliesthours he was destined for his cousin?
"""""Yes, and I had heard it before."
But what is that to me?
"If there isno other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly notbe kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him tomarry Miss de Bourgh."
You both did as much as you could in planning themarriage.
Its completion depended on others.
"If Mr. Darcy is neitherby honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to makeanother choice?"
"And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
"""""Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it."
"Yes,Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family orfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all."
"You willbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentionedby any of us."
"""""These are heavy misfortunes,"" replied Elizabeth."
"""But the wife of Mr.Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarilyattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no causeto repine."
"""""Obstinate, headstrong girl!"
I am ashamed of you!
Is this your gratitudefor my attentions to you last spring?
Is nothing due to me on thatscore?
Let us sit down.
"You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I camehere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor willI be dissuaded from it."
I have not been used to submit to any person'swhims.
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.
"""""_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;but it will have no effect on me."
"""""I will not be interrupted."
Hear me in silence.
My daughter and mynephew are formed for each other.
"They are descended, on the maternalside, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families."
Their fortune onboth sides is splendid.
"They are destined for each other by the voice ofevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,or fortune."
Is this to be endured!
"But it must not, shall not be."
"If youwere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere inwhich you have been brought up."
"""""In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting thatsphere."
"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we areequal.""""True."
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.
But who was your mother?Who are your uncles and aunts?
Do not imagine me ignorant of theircondition.
"""""Whatever my connections may be,"" said Elizabeth, ""if your nephew doesnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."
"""""Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"
"""Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging LadyCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after amoment's deliberation:""I am not."
"""Lady Catherine seemed pleased."
"""And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"
"""""I will make no promise of the kind."
"""""Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished."
I expected to find a morereasonable young woman.
But do not deceive yourself into a belief thatI will ever recede.
I shall not go away till you have given me theassurance I require.
"""""And I certainly _never_ shall give it."
I am not to be intimidated intoanything so wholly unreasonable.
Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marryyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make theirmarriage at all more probable?
"Supposing him to be attached to me, wouldmy refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you havesupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as theapplication was ill-judged."
"You have widely mistaken my character, ifyou think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these."
"How far yournephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine."
"I must beg,therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."
"""""Not so hasty, if you please."
I have by no means done.
"To all theobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add."
I amno stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamouselopement.
"I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was apatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles."
And issuch a girl to be my nephew's sister?
"Is her husband, is the son of hislate father's steward, to be his brother?"
Heaven and earth!--of what areyou thinking?
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?
"""""You can now have nothing further to say,"" she resentfully answered."
"""You have insulted me in every possible method."
I must beg to return tothe house.
"""And she rose as she spoke."
"Lady Catherine rose also, and they turnedback."
Her ladyship was highly incensed.
"""You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!Unfeeling, selfish girl!"
Do you not consider that a connection with youmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?
"""""Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say."
You know my sentiments.
"""""You are then resolved to have him?"
"""""I have said no such thing."
"I am only resolved to act in that manner,which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, withoutreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."
"""""It is well."
"You refuse, then, to oblige me."
"You refuse to obey theclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude."
"You are determined to ruin him inthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."
"""""Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,"" replied Elizabeth, ""have anypossible claim on me, in the present instance."
No principle of eitherwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.
"And with regard to theresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment'sconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join inthe scorn."
"""""And this is your real opinion!"
This is your final resolve!
Very well.I shall now know how to act.
"Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that yourambition will ever be gratified."
I came to try you.
"I hoped to find youreasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."
"""In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door ofthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, ""I take no leaveof you, Miss Bennet."
I send no compliments to your mother.
You deserveno such attention.
I am most seriously displeased.
"""Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade herladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself."
Sheheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.
"Her motherimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why LadyCatherine would not come in again and rest herself."
"""She did not choose it,"" said her daughter, ""she would go."
"""""She is a very fine-looking woman!"
and her calling here was prodigiouslycivil!
"for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses werewell."
"She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing throughMeryton, thought she might as well call on you."
"I suppose she hadnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"
"""Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for toacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threwElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for manyhours, learn to think of it less than incessantly."
"Lady Catherine, itappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.Darcy."
"It was a rational scheme, to be sure!"
"but from what the reportof their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when theexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supplythe idea."
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of hersister must bring them more frequently together.
"And her neighboursat Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with theCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), hadonly set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had lookedforward to as possible at some future time.In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not helpfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persistingin this interference."
"From what she had said of her resolution toprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditatean application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similarrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she darednot pronounce."
"She knew not the exact degree of his affection for hisaunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to supposethat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and itwas certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt wouldaddress him on his weakest side."
"With his notions of dignity, he wouldprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weakand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had oftenseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation mightsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignityunblemished could make him."
In that case he would return no more.
LadyCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement toBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
"""If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to hisfriend within a few days,"" she added, ""I shall know how to understandit."
"I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of hisconstancy."
"If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he mighthave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret himat all."""
"* * * * *The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor hadbeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the samekind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; andElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by herfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand."
"""Lizzy,"" said he, ""I was going to look for you; come into my room."
"""She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had totell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some mannerconnected with the letter he held."
"It suddenly struck her that itmight be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all theconsequent explanations.She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down."
"Hethen said,""I have received a letter this morning that has astonished meexceedingly."
"As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know itscontents."
"I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brinkof matrimony."
Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.
"""The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneousconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explainedhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed toherself; when her father continued:""You look conscious."
"Young ladies have great penetration in such mattersas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover thename of your admirer."
This letter is from Mr.
Collins.
"""""From Mr. Collins!"
and what can _he_ have to say?
"""""Something very much to the purpose of course."
"He begins withcongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, ofwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossipingLucases."
"I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he sayson that point."
"What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thusoffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself onthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;of which we have been advertised by the same authority."
"Your daughterElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, afterher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate maybe reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages inthis land."
"'""Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?"
"'This younggentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart ofmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensivepatronage."
"Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousinElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitateclosure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will beinclined to take immediate advantage of."
"'""Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?"
"But now it comes out:""'My motive for cautioning you is as follows."
"We have reason to imaginethat his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match witha friendly eye.'""_Mr."
"Darcy_, you see, is the man!"
"Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_surprised you."
"Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man withinthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the liemore effectually to what they related?"
"Mr. Darcy, who never looks at anywoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in hislife!"
It is admirable!
"""Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only forceone most reluctant smile."
Never had his wit been directed in a manner solittle agreeable to her.
"""Are you not diverted?""""Oh!"
yes.
Pray read on.
"""""'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship lastnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what shefelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of somefamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give herconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match."
"I thought it my dutyto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she andher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not runhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.'"
"Mr.Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sadbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that theirliving together before the marriage took place should be so generallyknown."
"I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrainfrom declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the youngcouple into your house as soon as they were married."
"It was anencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I shouldvery strenuously have opposed it."
"You ought certainly to forgive them,as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow theirnames to be mentioned in your hearing.'"
That is his notion of Christianforgiveness!
"The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte'ssituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch."
"But, Lizzy, youlook as if you did not enjoy it."
"You are not going to be _missish_,I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report."
"For what do welive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in ourturn?""""Oh!"""
"cried Elizabeth, ""I am excessively diverted."
But it is sostrange!
"""""Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing."
"Had they fixed on any other manit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!"
"Much as I abominatewriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for anyconsideration."
"Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help givinghim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence andhypocrisy of my son-in-law."
"And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherineabout this report?"
Did she call to refuse her consent?
"""To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it hadbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed byhis repeating it."
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make herfeelings appear what they were not.
"It was necessary to laugh, when shewould rather have cried."
"Her father had most cruelly mortified her, bywhat he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing butwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead ofhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, asElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcywith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine'svisit."
"The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had timeto tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter satin momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposedtheir all walking out."
It was agreed to.
Mrs. Bennet was not in thehabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining fiveset off together.
"Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the othersto outstrip them."
"They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcywere to entertain each other."
"Very little was said by either; Kittywas too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming adesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call uponMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone."
"Now was themoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage washigh, she immediately said:""Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of givingrelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours."
Ican no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to mypoor sister.
"Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious toacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it."
"Were it known to the restof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."
"""""I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,"" replied Darcy, in a tone of surpriseand emotion, ""that you have ever been informed of what may, in amistaken light, have given you uneasiness."
I did not think Mrs. Gardinerwas so little to be trusted.
"""""You must not blame my aunt."
"Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed tome that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I couldnot rest till I knew the particulars."
"Let me thank you again and again,in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which inducedyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for thesake of discovering them."
"""""If you _will_ thank me,"" he replied, ""let it be for yourself alone.That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the otherinducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny."
But your_family_ owe me nothing.
"Much as I respect them, I believe I thoughtonly of _you_."
"""Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word."
"After a short pause,her companion added, ""You are too generous to trifle with me."
"If yourfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once."
"_My_affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silenceme on this subject for ever."
"""Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety ofhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though notvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergoneso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to makeher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances."
"Thehappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably neverfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and aswarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do."
"Had Elizabethbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well theexpression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her offeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made hisaffection every moment more valuable.They walked on, without knowing in what direction."
"There was too much tobe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects."
"Shesoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understandingto the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return throughLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and thesubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically onevery expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief thatsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promisefrom her nephew which she had refused to give."
"But, unluckily for herladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise."
"""It taught me to hope,"" said he, ""as I had scarcely ever allowed myselfto hope before."
"I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would haveacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."
"""Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, ""Yes, you know enoughof my frankness to believe me capable of _that_."
"After abusing you soabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to allyour relations."
"""""What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?"
"For, though youraccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, mybehaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof."
It wasunpardonable.
I cannot think of it without abhorrence.
"""""We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to thatevening,"" said Elizabeth."
"""The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improvedin civility."
"""""I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself."
"The recollection of what Ithen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole ofit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me."
"Yourreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in amore gentlemanlike manner.'"
Those were your words.
"You know not, you canscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."
"""""I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong animpression."
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in sucha way.
"""""I can easily believe it."
"You thought me then devoid of every properfeeling, I am sure you did."
"The turn of your countenance I shall neverforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possibleway that would induce you to accept me.""""Oh!"
do not repeat what I then said.
These recollections will not do atall.
I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.
"""Darcy mentioned his letter."
"""Did it,"" said he, ""did it soon make youthink better of me?"
"Did you, on reading it, give any credit to itscontents?"
"""She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all herformer prejudices had been removed."
"""I knew,"" said he, ""that what I wrote must give you pain, but it wasnecessary."
I hope you have destroyed the letter.
"There was one partespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having thepower of reading again."
I can remember some expressions which mightjustly make you hate me.
"""""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to thepreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think myopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easilychanged as that implies."
"""""When I wrote that letter,"" replied Darcy, ""I believed myself perfectlycalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in adreadful bitterness of spirit."
"""""The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so."
Theadieu is charity itself.
But think no more of the letter.
"The feelingsof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are nowso widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasantcircumstance attending it ought to be forgotten."
You must learn someof my philosophy.
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives youpleasure.
"""""I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind."
"Yourretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentmentarising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, ofinnocence."
"But with me, it is not so."
"Painful recollections will intrudewhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled."
"I have been a selfishbeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle."
"As a child Iwas taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper."
"Iwas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoiltby my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, allthat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taughtme to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own familycircle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at leastto think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own."
"Such Iwas, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have beenbut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!"
What do I not owe you!
"Youtaught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous."
"By you,I was properly humbled."
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a womanworthy of being pleased.
"""""Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"
"""""Indeed I had."
What will you think of my vanity?
"I believed you to bewishing, expecting my addresses."
"""""My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assureyou."
"I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead mewrong."
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?
"""""Hate you!"
"I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to takea proper direction."
"""""I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met atPemberley."
You blamed me for coming?
"""""No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."
"""""Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and Iconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."
"""""My object then,"" replied Darcy, ""was to show you, by every civility inmy power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped toobtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting yousee that your reproofs had been attended to."
"How soon any other wishesintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half anhour after I had seen you."
"""He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of herdisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading tothe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution offollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formedbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulnessthere had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose mustcomprehend.She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject toeach, to be dwelt on farther.After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to knowanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, thatit was time to be at home."
"""What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"""
was a wonder whichintroduced the discussion of their affairs.
Darcy was delighted withtheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information ofit.
"""I must ask whether you were surprised?"""
said Elizabeth.
"""Not at all."
"When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."
"""""That is to say, you had given your permission."
"I guessed as much."""
"Andthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty muchthe case."
"""On the evening before my going to London,"" said he, ""I made aconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago."
Itold him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in hisaffairs absurd and impertinent.
His surprise was great.
He had never hadthe slightest suspicion.
"I told him, moreover, that I believed myselfmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferentto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her wasunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."
"""Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing hisfriend."
"""Did you speak from your own observation,"" said she, ""when you told himthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"
"""""From the former."
I had narrowly observed her during the two visitswhich I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.
"""""And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction tohim."
"""""It did."
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.
"His diffidence hadprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, buthis reliance on mine made every thing easy."
"I was obliged to confessone thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him."
"I could notallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three monthslast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him."
He wasangry.
"But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remainedin any doubt of your sister's sentiments."
He has heartily forgiven menow.
"""Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightfulfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checkedherself."
"She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,and it was rather too early to begin."
"In anticipating the happinessof Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, hecontinued the conversation till they reached the house."
In the hall theyparted.
"""My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"""
"was a questionwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,and from all the others when they sat down to table."
"She had only tosay in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her ownknowledge."
"She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anythingelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary."
"Theacknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happythan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,there were other evils before her."
She anticipated what would be feltin the family when her situation became known; she was aware that noone liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was adislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.At night she opened her heart to Jane.
"Though suspicion was very farfrom Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here."
"""You are joking, Lizzy."
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy!
"No, no,you shall not deceive me."
I know it to be impossible.
"""""This is a wretched beginning indeed!"
"My sole dependence was on you; andI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not."
"Yet, indeed, I amin earnest."
I speak nothing but the truth.
"He still loves me, and we areengaged."
"""Jane looked at her doubtingly."
"""Oh, Lizzy!"
it cannot be.
I know how muchyou dislike him.
"""""You know nothing of the matter."
_That_ is all to be forgot.
Perhaps Idid not always love him so well as I do now.
"But in such cases asthese, a good memory is unpardonable."
This is the last time I shall everremember it myself.
"""Miss Bennet still looked all amazement."
"Elizabeth again, and moreseriously assured her of its truth."
"""Good Heaven!"
can it be really so!
"Yet now I must believe you,"" criedJane."
"""My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are youcertain?"
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can behappy with him?
"""""There can be no doubt of that."
"It is settled between us already, thatwe are to be the happiest couple in the world."
"But are you pleased,Jane?"
Shall you like to have such a brother?
"""""Very, very much."
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself moredelight.
"But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible."
And do youreally love him quite well enough?
"Oh, Lizzy!"
do anything rather thanmarry without affection.
Are you quite sure that you feel what you oughtto do?
"""""Oh, yes!"
"You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when Itell you all."
"""""What do you mean?"
"""""Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley."
I amafraid you will be angry.
"""""My dearest sister, now _be_ serious."
I want to talk very seriously.
"Letme know every thing that I am to know, without delay."
Will you tell mehow long you have loved him?
"""""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful groundsat Pemberley."
"""Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced thedesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurancesof attachment."
"When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothingfurther to wish."
"""Now I am quite happy,"" said she, ""for you will be as happy as myself.I always had a value for him."
"Were it for nothing but his love of you,I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and yourhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me."
"ButLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me."
How little did youtell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!
"I owe all that I knowof it to another, not to you."
"""Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy."
She had been unwillingto mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had madeher equally avoid the name of his friend.
But now she would no longerconceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage.
"All was acknowledged,and half the night spent in conversation."
"* * * * *""Good gracious!"""
"cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the nextmorning, ""if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again withour dear Bingley!"
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be alwayscoming here?
"I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something orother, and not disturb us with his company."
"What shall we do with him?Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley'sway."
"""Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yetwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such anepithet.As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, andshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;and he soon afterwards said aloud, ""Mrs. Bennet, have you no more laneshereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"
"""""I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""to walkto Oakham Mount this morning."
"It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy hasnever seen the view."
"""""It may do very well for the others,"" replied Mr. Bingley; ""but I amsure it will be too much for Kitty."
"Won't it, Kitty?"""
Kitty owned thatshe had rather stay at home.
"Darcy professed a great curiosity to seethe view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented."
"As she wentup stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:""I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have thatdisagreeable man all to yourself."
"But I hope you will not mind it: it isall for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talkingto him, except just now and then."
"So, do not put yourself toinconvenience."
"""During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should beasked in the course of the evening."
Elizabeth reserved to herself theapplication for her mother's.
She could not determine how her motherwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeurwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.
"But whether shewere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, itwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do creditto her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hearthe first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of herdisapprobation."
"* * * * *In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she sawMr."
"Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it wasextreme."
"She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going tobe made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should befilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretchedreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile."
"In a few minuteshe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, whilepretending to admire her work said in a whisper, ""Go to your father, hewants you in the library."""
"She was gone directly.Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious."
"""Lizzy,"" said he, ""what are you doing?"
"Are you out of your senses, to beaccepting this man?"
Have not you always hated him?
"""How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been morereasonable, her expressions more moderate!"
"It would have spared her fromexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,of her attachment to Mr."
Darcy.
"""Or, in other words, you are determined to have him."
"He is rich, to besure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.But will they make you happy?"
"""""Have you any other objection,"" said Elizabeth, ""than your belief of myindifference?"
"""""None at all."
"We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; butthis would be nothing if you really liked him."
"""""I do, I do like him,"" she replied, with tears in her eyes, ""I love him.Indeed he has no improper pride."
He is perfectly amiable.
You do notknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him insuch terms.
"""""Lizzy,"" said her father, ""I have given him my consent."
"He is the kindof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which hecondescended to ask."
"I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved onhaving him."
But let me advise you to think better of it.
"I knowyour disposition, Lizzy."
"I know that you could be neither happy norrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you lookedup to him as a superior."
Your lively talents would place you in thegreatest danger in an unequal marriage.
You could scarcely escapediscredit and misery.
"My child, let me not have the grief of seeing_you_ unable to respect your partner in life."
You know not what you areabout.
"""Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; andat length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the objectof her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation ofhim had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affectionwas not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she didconquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match."
"""Well, my dear,"" said he, when she ceased speaking, ""I have no more tosay."
"If this be the case, he deserves you."
"I could not have parted withyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."
"""To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcyhad voluntarily done for Lydia."
He heard her with astonishment.
"""This is an evening of wonders, indeed!"
"And so, Darcy did every thing;made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got himhis commission!"
So much the better.
It will save me a world of troubleand economy.
"Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ havepaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their ownway."
"I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm abouthis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."
"""He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his readingMr."
"Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed herat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, ""If any young men comefor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."
"""Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, afterhalf an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to jointhe others with tolerable composure."
"Every thing was too recent forgaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longeranything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiaritywould come in time.When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,and made the important communication."
"Its effect was most extraordinary;for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable toutter a syllable."
"Nor was it under many, many minutes that she couldcomprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to creditwhat was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of alover to any of them."
"She began at length to recover, to fidget about inher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself."
"""Good gracious!"
Lord bless me!
only think!
dear me!
Mr. Darcy!
Who wouldhave thought it!
And is it really true?
Oh!

Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.
I am sopleased--so happy.
Such a charming man!--so handsome!
"so tall!--Oh, mydear Lizzy!"

Ihope he will overlook it.
"Dear, dear Lizzy."

Three daughters married!
Ten thousand a year!

What will become of me.
I shall go distracted.
"""This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: andElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,soon went away."
"But before she had been three minutes in her own room,her mother followed her."
"""My dearest child,"" she cried, ""I can think of nothing else!"
"Tenthousand a year, and very likely more!"
'Tis as good as a Lord!
And aspecial licence.
You must and shall be married by a special licence.
"Butmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,that I may have it to-morrow."
"""This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentlemanhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certainpossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'consent, there was still something to be wished for."
"But the morrowpassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stoodin such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak tohim, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark herdeference for his opinion.Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to getacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was risingevery hour in his esteem."
"""I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,"" said he."
"""Wickham, perhaps,is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as wellas Jane's."
"""Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her."

"""""You may as well call it impertinence at once."
"It was very little less.The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officiousattention."
"You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone."
"I roused, andinterested you, because I was so unlike _them_."
"Had you not been reallyamiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains youtook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; andin your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduouslycourted you."
"There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting forit; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectlyreasonable."
"To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinksof _that_ when they fall in love."

Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world thathe can spare from me.
"You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.Yours, etc.""Mr."
"Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and stilldifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in replyto his last."
"""DEAR SIR,""I must trouble you once more for congratulations."
Elizabeth will soonbe the wife of Mr. Darcy.
"Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew."
He has more to give.
"""Yours sincerely, etc."
"""Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approachingmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere."
"She wrote evento Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all herformer professions of regard."
"Jane was not deceived, but she wasaffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writingher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,was as sincere as her brother's in sending it."
"Four sides of paper wereinsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire ofbeing loved by her sister.Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulationsto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that theCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge."
The reason of thissudden removal was soon evident.
"Lady Catherine had been renderedso exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, thatCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away tillthe storm was blown over."
"At such a moment, the arrival of her friendwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of theirmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when shesaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility ofher husband."
"He bore it, however, with admirable calmness."
"He could evenlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying awaythe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their allmeeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure."
"If he didshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.Mrs."
"Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on hisforbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood intoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's goodhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at alllikely to make her more elegant."
"Elizabeth did all she could to shieldhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keephim to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might conversewithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arisingfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, itadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight tothe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasingto either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party atPemberley.Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet gotrid of her two most deserving daughters."
"With what delighted prideshe afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, maybe guessed."
"I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that theaccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so manyof her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps itwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicityin so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous andinvariably silly.Mr."
Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for herdrew him oftener from home than anything else could do.
"He delighted ingoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.Mr."
Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.
"So neara vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart."
"The darling wish of hissisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring countyto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other sourceof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time withher two elder sisters."
"In society so superior to what she had generallyknown, her improvement was great."
"She was not of so ungovernable atemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, lessignorant, and less insipid."
"From the further disadvantage of Lydia'ssociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickhamfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise ofballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarilydrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quiteunable to sit alone."
"Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, butshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was nolonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change withoutmuch reluctance.As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution fromthe marriage of her sisters."
"He bore with philosophy the conviction thatElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitudeand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed onto make his fortune."
"The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth receivedfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,if not by himself, such a hope was cherished."
"The letter was to thiseffect:""MY DEAR LIZZY,""I wish you joy."
"If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dearWickham, you must be very happy."
"It is a great comfort to have you sorich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do notthink we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not."
"""Yours, etc."
"""As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured inher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practiceof what might be called economy in her own private expences, shefrequently sent them."
"It had always been evident to her that such anincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant intheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient totheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane orherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistancetowards discharging their bills."
"Their manner of living, even when therestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in theextreme."
"They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheapsituation, and always spending more than they ought."
"His affection forher soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; andin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims toreputation which her marriage had given her.Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, forElizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession."
"Lydia wasoccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himselfin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequentlystaid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and heproceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as shethought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, shedropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost asattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civilityto Elizabeth.Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisterswas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see."
They were able to love eachother even as well as they intended.
"Georgiana had the highest opinionin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened withan astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner oftalking to her brother."
"He, who had always inspired in herself a respectwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of openpleasantry."
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallenin her way.
"By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend thata woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will notalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character inher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent himlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some timeall intercourse was at an end."
"But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, herresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosityto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to waiton them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods hadreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but thevisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both eversensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringingher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.}"
